## Stored PKL Files with Dictionaries

This repository contains a collection of PKL (Python Pickle) files, each containing dictionaries. These files serve as pre-processed data that can be utilized to bypass the data extraction step from large PDFs. If you're running notebooks in Google Colab or any other environment, you can leverage these files to streamline your workflow.


### Usage:

1. Clone the repository or download the desired PKL files directly.
2. Utilize these files in your Python scripts or notebooks to access pre-processed data without the need for data extraction from large PDFs.
3. **Ensure you're replacing the correct files at the appropriate points in your code when loading PKL files.**
4. Load the dictionaries from the PKL files using Python's `pickle` module or any other appropriate method for deserialization.

### Example:

```python
import pickle

# Load the dictionary from the PKL file
with open('Trained Models and PKL Files/Folder_1/data_dict_1.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    data_dict = pickle.load(f)

# Access the data from the dictionary
# Example:
# data = data_dict['key']
```

### Note:

- Ensure compatibility of the PKL files with your Python environment.
- Check the documentation or code comments within the repository for further details on the contents and usage of each PKL file.
