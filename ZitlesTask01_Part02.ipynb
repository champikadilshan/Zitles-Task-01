Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:\\n\\n1. Payment of Principal, Interest, Escrow Items, Prepayment Charges, and Late Charges.\\nBorrower shall pay when due the principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and any\\nprepayment charges and late charges due under the Note. Borrower shall also pay funds for Escrow Items\\npursuant to Section 3. Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be made in U.S.\\ncurrency. However, if any check or other instrument received by Lender as payment under the Note or this\\nSecurity Instrument is returned to Lender unpaid, Lender may require that any or all subsequent payments\\ndue under the Note and this Security Instrument be made in one or more of the following forms, as\\nselected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer\\'s check or\\ncashier\\'s check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a\\nfederal agency, instrumentality, or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer.\\n\\nPayments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at\\nsuch other location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 15.\\nLender may return any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are insufficient to\\nbring the Loan current. Lender may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan\\ncurrent, without waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or partial\\npayments in the future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such payments at the time such payments are\\naccepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay\\ninterest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment to bring\\nthe Loan current. If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either apply\\nsuch funds or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be applied to the outstanding\\nprincipal balance under the Note immediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or claim which Borrower\\nmight have now or in the future against Lender shall relieve Borrower from making payments due under\\nthe Note and this Security Instrument or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security\\nInstrument.\\n\\n2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, all\\npayments accepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority: (a) interest\\ndue under the Note; (b) principal due under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3. Such payments\\nshall be applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in which it became due. Any remaining amounts\\nshall be applied first to late charges, second to any other amounts due under this Security Instrument, and\\nthen to reduce the principal balance of the Note.\\n\\nIf Lender receives a payment trom Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a\\nsufficient amount to pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and\\nthe late charge. If more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received\\nfrom Borrower to the repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each payment can be\\npaid in full. To the extent that any cxccss exists after the payment is applied to the full payment of onc or\\nmore Periodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any late charges due. Voluntary prepayments shall\\nbe applied first to any prepayment charges and then as described in the Note.\\n\\nAny application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under\\nthe Note shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments.\\n\\n3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due\\nunder the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the \"Funds\") to provide for payment of amounts due\\nfor: (a) taxes and assessments and other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a\\nlien or encumbrance on the Property; (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; (c)\\npremiums for any and all insurance required by Lender under Section 5; and (d) Mortgage Insurance\\npremiums, if any, or any sums payable by Borrower to Lender in lieu of the payment of Mortgage\\nInsurance premiums in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. These items are called \"Escrow\\nItems.\" At origination or at any time during the term of the Loan, Lender may require that Community\\nAssociation Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and\\nassessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to\\nbe paid under this Section.

Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on\\nthe Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term \"extended coverage,\" and any\\nother hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance.\\nThis insurance shall be maintained in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that\\nLender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can change during the term of\\nthe Loan. The insurance carrier providing the insurance shall be chosen by Borrower subject to Lender\\'s\\nTight to disapprove Borrower\\'s choice, which right shall not be exercised unreasonably. Lender may\\nrequire Borrower to pay, in connection with this Loan, either: (a) a one-time charge for flood zone\\ndetermination, certification and tracking services; or (b) a one-time charge for flood zone determination\\nand certification services and subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which\\nreasonably might affect such determination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the\\npayment of any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the\\nreview of any flood zone determination resulting from an objection by Borrower.\\n\\nIf Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance\\ncoverage, at Lender\\'s option and Borrower\\'s expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any\\nparticular type or amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might\\nnot protect Borrower, Borrower\\'s equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk,\\nhazard or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect. Borrower\\nacknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained might significantly exceed the cost of\\ninsurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 5 shall\\nbecome additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest\\nat the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from\\nLender to Borrower requesting payment.\\n\\nAll insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender\\'s\\nright to disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name Lender as\\nmortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and renewal\\ncertificates. lf Lender requires, Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and\\nrenewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender,\\nfor damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such policy shall include a standard mortgage clause and\\nshall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.\\n\\nIn the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender.

Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree\\nin writing, any insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall\\nbe applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and\\nLender\\'s security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to\\nhold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the\\nwork has been completed to Lender\\'s satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken\\npromptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series\\nof progress payments as the work is completed.

If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the\\ninsurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day\\nperiod will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under\\nSection 22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower\\'s rights to any insurance\\nproceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, and\\n(b) any other of Borrower\\'s rights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by\\nBorrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to the\\ncoverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property or\\nto pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.\\n\\n6. Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower\\'s principal\\ntesidence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the\\nProperty as Borrower\\'s principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender\\notherwise agrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating\\ncircumstances exist which are beyond Borrower\\'s control.\\n\\n7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower shall not\\ndestroy, damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the\\nProperty. Whether or not Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain the Property in\\norder to prevent the Property from deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless it is\\ndetermined pursuant to Section 5 that repair or restoration is not economically feasible, Borrower shall\\npromptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further deterioration or damage. If insurance or\\ncondemnation proceeds are paid in connection with damage to, or the taking of, the Property, Borrower\\nshall be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender has released proceeds for such\\npurposes. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of\\nprogress payments as the work is completed. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient\\nto repair or restore the Property, Borrower is not relieved of Borrower\\'s obligation for the completion of\\nsuch repair or restoration,\\n\\nLender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If it has\\nreasonable cause, Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender shall give\\nBorrower notice at the time of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.\\n\\n8. Borrower\\'s Loan Application. Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application\\nprocess, Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower\\'s\\nknowledge or consent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender\\n(or failed to provide Lender with material information) in connection with the Loan. Material\\nrepresentations include, but are not limited to, representations concerning Borrower\\'s occupancy of the\\nProperty as Borrower\\'s principal residence.\\n\\n9. Protection of Lender\\'s Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument. If\\n(a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there\\nis a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender\\'s interest in the Property and/or rights under\\nthis Security Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for\\nenforcement of a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument or to enforce laws or\\nregulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is\\nreasonable or appropriate to protect Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights under this Security\\nInstrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property, and securing and/or repairing\\nthe Property. Lender\\'s actions can include, but are not limited to: (a) paying any sums secured by a lien\\nwhich has priority over this Security Instrument; (b) appearing in court; and (c) paying reasonable\\n\\nSOUTH CAROLINA - Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT, MERS\\nB® -6A(SC) 113021.00 Page 7 of 15 Initials, Form 3041 1/01\\n\\n1 Cy\\n3467559578 0233 35\\n\\nq034675595 233 350 0715\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nattorneys’ fees to protect its interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including\\nits secured position in a bankruptcy procecding.

Although Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so and is not\\nunder any duty or obligation to do so. It is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking any or ail\\nactions authorized under this Section 9.\\n\\nAny amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower\\nsecured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of\\ndisbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting\\npayment,\\n\\nIf this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of the\\nlease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge unless\\nLender agrees to the merger in writing.\\n\\n10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan,\\nBorrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If, for any reason,\\nthe Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available from the mortgage insurer that\\npreviously provided such insurance and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments\\ntoward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to obtain\\ncoverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, at a cost substantially\\nequivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate\\nmortgage insurer selected by Lender. If substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not\\navailable, Borrower shall continue to pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that\\nwere due when the insurance coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these\\npayments as a non-refundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shali be\\nnon-refundable, notwithstanding the fact that the Loan is ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be\\nrequired to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such loss reserve. Lender can no longer require loss\\nreserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the amount and for the period that Lender requires)\\nprovided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires\\nseparately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage\\nInsurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated\\npayments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to\\nmaintain Mortgage Insurance in effect, or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until Lender\\'s\\nrequirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance with any written agreement between Borrower and\\nLender providing for such termination or until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this\\nSection 10 affects Borrower\\'s obligation to pay interest at the rate provided in the Note.\\n\\nMortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it\\nmay incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage\\nInsurance.\\n\\nMortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may\\nenter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agreements\\nare on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other party (or parties) to\\nthese agreements. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source\\nof funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage\\nInsurance premiums).\\n\\nAs a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any reinsurer,\\nany other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that\\nderive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower\\'s payments for Mortgage Insurance, in\\nexchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer\\'s risk, or reducing losses. If such agreement\\nprovides that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the insurer\\'s risk in exchange for a share of the\\npremiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often termed \"captive reinsurance.” Further:\\n\\n(a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for\\nMortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the amount\\nBorrower will owe for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund.\\n\\nSOUTH CAROLINA - Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMEN MERS\\nBD -eaisc (1302}.00 Page 8 of 15 Initials, Form 3041 1/04\\nq03467559573 0233 350 0815\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\na\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has - if any - with respect to the\\nMortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other law.

Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds are hereby\\nassigned to and shall be paid to Lender.\\n\\nIf the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of\\nthe Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender\\'s security is not lessened.\\nDuring such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds\\nuntil Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to\\nLender\\'s satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly.

Any balance shall be paid to Borrower.\\n\\nIn the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market\\nvalue of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the\\namount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless\\nBorrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums\\nsecured by this Security Instrument whether or not the sums are then due.\\n\\nIf the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the\\nOpposing Party (as defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages,\\nBorrower fails to respond to Lender within 30 days after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized\\nto collect and apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the\\nsums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due. \"Opposing Party\" means the third party\\nthat owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom Borrower has a right of action in\\nregard to Miscellaneous Proceeds.\\n\\nBorrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in\\nLender\\'s judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender\\'s\\ninterest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument.

The proceeds of\\nany award or claim for damages that are attributable to the impairment of Lender\\'s interest in the Property\\nare hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender.\\n\\nAll Miscetlaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be\\napplied in the order provided for in Section 2.\\n\\n03467559578 0233 350 0915\\nSOUTH CAROLINA - Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMEN,\\nSS -saisc) (1302).00 Page 9 of 15 Initials:\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n\\nERS\\nForm 3041 1/04\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nEz\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n12.

Extension of the time for\\npayment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender\\nto Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower\\nor any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against\\nany Successor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify\\namortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original\\nBorrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or\\nremedy including, without limitation, Lender\\'s acceptance of payments from third persons, entities or\\nSuccessors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or\\npreclude the exercise of any right or remedy.\\n\\n13.

Borrower shall not be released from\\nBorrower\\'s obligations and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in\\nwriting. The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind (except as provided in\\nSection 20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender.\\n\\n14, Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with\\nBorrower\\'s default, for the purpose of protecting Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights under this\\nSecurity Instrument, including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees, property inspection and valuation fees.\\nIn regard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific\\nfee to Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge\\nfees that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.\\n\\nIf the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so\\nthat the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the\\npermitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the\\ncharge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted\\nlimits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal\\nowed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the\\nreduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a\\nprepayment charge is provided for under the Note). Borrower\\'s acceptance of any such refund made by\\ndirect payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out\\nof such overcharge.\\n\\n15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument\\nmust be in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to\\nhave been given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower\\'s\\nnotice address if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers\\nunless Applicable Law expressly requircs otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address\\nunless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly\\nnotify Lender of Borrower\\'s change of address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower\\'s\\nchange of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that specified procedure.\\nThere may be only one designated notice address under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any\\nnotice to Lender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender\\'s address\\nstated herein unless Lender has designated another address by notice to Borrower.

If Borrower meets certain conditions,\\nBorrower shall have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time\\nprior to the earliest of: (a) five days before sale of the Property pursuant to Section 22 of this Security\\nInstrument; (b) such other period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Borrower\\'s right\\nto reinstate; or (c) entry of a judgment enforcing this Security Instrument. Those conditions are that\\nBorrower: (a) pays Lender all sums which then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note\\nas if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements; (c) pays all\\nexpenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’\\nfees, property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender\\'s\\ninterest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument; and (d) takes such action as Lender may\\nreasonably require to assure that Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights under this Security\\nInstrument, and Borrower\\'s obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument, shall continue\\nunchanged. Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of\\nthe following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check,\\ntreasurer\\'s check or cashier\\'s check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits\\nare insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer. Upon\\nreinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and obligations secured hereby shall remain fully\\neffective as if no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not apply in the case of\\nacceleration under Section 18.\\n\\n20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial interest in\\nthe Note (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to\\nBorrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the \"Loan Servicer\") that collects\\nPeriodic Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan\\nservicing obligations under the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be\\none or more changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. If there is a change of the Loan\\nServicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will state the name and address of the\\nnew Loan Servicer, the address to which payments should be made and any other information RESPA\\n\\nSOUTH CAROLINA - Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT MERS\\nBD -6nsc) (1302}.00 Page 11 of 15 Initials: ¢ Form 3041 1/01\\n\\nHQ a\\n\\n75998 233 350 1415\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nrequires in connection with a notice of transfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is\\nserviced by a Loan Servicer other than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations\\nto Borrower will remain with the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not\\nassumed by the Note purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.\\n\\nNeither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an\\nindividual litigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party\\'s actions pursuant to this\\nSecurity Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by\\nreason of, this Security Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such\\nnotice given in compliance with the requirements of Section 15) of such alleged breach and afforded the\\nother party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. If\\nApplicable Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time\\nperiod will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and\\nopportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to\\nBorrower pursuant to Section 18 shalt be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective\\naction provisions of this Section 20.\\n\\n21. Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 21: (a) \"Hazardous Substances\" are those\\nsubstances defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law and the\\nfollowing substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides\\nand herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials;\\n(b) \"Environmental Law\" means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that\\nrelate to health, safety or environmental protection; (c) \"Environmental Cleanup\" includes any response\\naction, remedial action, or removal action, as defined in Environmental Law; and (d) an \"Environmental\\nCondition\" means a condition that can cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger an Environmental\\nCleanup. :\\n\\nBorrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous\\nSubstances, or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do,\\nnor allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property (a) that is in violation of any Environmental\\nLaw, (b) which creates an Environmental Condition, or (c) which, due to the presence, use, or release of a\\nHazardous Substance, creates a condition that adversely affects the value of the Property. The preceding\\ntwo sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of\\nHazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to\\nmaintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products).\\n\\nBorrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit\\nor other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any\\nHazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any\\nEnvironmental Condition, including but not limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of\\ntelease of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) any condition caused by the presence, use or release of a\\nHazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified\\nby any governniental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or other remediation\\nof any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary\\nremedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on\\nLender for an Environmental Cleanup.\\n\\n$0 1215\\n\\n03467559578 0233 3\\nSOUTH CAROLINA - Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUME| MERS\\n\\nBB -saisc) (4302).00 Page 12 of 15 Initials: Form 3041 1/01\\n\\n   \\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nB\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nNON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:\\n\\n22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration\\nfollowing Borrower\\'s breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior\\nto acceleration under Section 18 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise). The notice shall specify:\\n(a) the default; (b) the action required to cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the\\ndate the notice is given to Borrower, by which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure\\nthe default on or before the date specified in the notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured\\nby this Security Instrument, foreclosure by judicial proceeding and sale of the Property. The notice\\nshall further inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to assert in the\\nforeclosure proceeding the non-existence of a default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration\\nand foreclosure. If the default is not cured on or before the date specified in the notice, Lender at its\\noption may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument\\nwithout further demand and may foreclose this Security Instrument by judicial proceeding. Lender\\nshall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Section 22,\\nincluding, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\\' fees and costs of title evidence, all of which shall\\nbe additional sums secured by this Security Instrument.\\n\\n23. Release. Upon Payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, this Security Instrument\\nshall become null and void. Lender shall release this Security Instrument. Borrower shall pay any\\nrecordation costs. Lender may charge Borrower a fee for releasing this Security Instrument, but only if the\\nfee is paid to a third party for services rendered and the charging of the fee is permitted under Applicable\\nLaw.\\n\\n24, Homestead Waiver. Borrower waives all rights of homestead exemption in the Property to the\\nextent allowed by Applicable Law.\\n\\n25, Waiver of Appraisal Rights. The laws of South Carolina provide that in any real estate\\nforeclosure proceeding a defendant against whom a personal judgment is taken or asked may within 30\\ndays after the sale of the mortgaged property apply to the court for an order of appraisal. The statutory\\nappraisal value as approved by the court would be substituted for the high bid and may decrease the\\namount of any deficiency owing in connection with the transaction. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\\nLAW, THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY WAIVES AND RELINQUISHES THE STATUTORY\\nAPPRAISAL RIGHTS WHICH MEANS THE HIGH BID AT THE JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE SALE\\nWILL BE APPLIED TO THE DEBT REGARDLESS OF ANY APPRAISED VALUE OF THE\\nMORTGAGED PROPERTY. This waiver shall not apply so long as the Property is used as a dwelling\\nplace as defined in Section 12-37-250 of the South Carolina Code of Laws.\\n\\n26. Future Advances. The lien of this Security Instrument shall secure the existing indebtedness\\nunder the Note and any future advances made under this Security Instrument up to 150% of the original\\nprincipal amount of the Note plus interest thereon, attorneys’ fees and court costs.\\n\\nq03467559578 0233 350 1315\\n\\nSOUTH CAROLINA - Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUME!

For purposes of this Article, the entity having jurisdiction in a\\nparticular case shall be referred to as the “Reviewer.”\\n\\n(d) Fees: Assistance. The Reviewer may establish and charge reasonable fees for\\nreview of applications hereunder and may require such fees to be paid in full prior to review of\\nany application. Such fees may include the reasonable costs incurred in having any application\\nreviewed by architects, engineers, or other professionals.\\n\\n5.3. Guidelines and Procedures.\\n\\n(a) Architectural Guidelines. Declarant may prepare Architectural Guidelines\\napplicable to Units which may contain general provisions applicable to all Units as well as\\nspecific provisions which vary among the Units according to location, Neighborhood, use, or\\nother factors. The Architectural Guidelines are intended to provide guidance to Owners\\nregarding matters of particular concern to the Reviewer in considering applications hereunder.\\nThe Architectural Guidelines are not the exclusive basis for the Reviewer’s decisions, and\\ncompliance with the Architectural Guidelines does not guarantee approval of any application.\\nFurther, the Architectural Guidelines may be more restrictive than guidelines followed by\\nCharleston County or as set forth in the International Builder’s Code.\\n\\nDeclarant shall have sole and full authority to amend the Architectural Guidelines during\\nthe Declarant Annexation Period, notwithstanding a delegation of reviewing authority, unless\\nDeclarant also delegates the power to amend. Upon termination or delegation of Declarant’s\\nright to amend, the ARC shall have the authority to amend the Architectural Guidelines with the\\nBoard’s consent. Any amendments to the Architectural Guidelines shall be prospective only and\\nshall not apply to require modifications to or removal of structures previously approved once the\\napproved construction or modification has commenced. There shall be no limitation on the\\nscope of amendments to the Architectural Guidelines, and such amendments may remove\\nrequirements previously imposed or otherwise make the Architectural Guidelines less restrictive.\\n\\nThe Association shall maintain a copy of the Architectural Guidelines, as they may exist\\nfrom time to time, and shall make them available to Owners for inspection and copying upon\\nreasonable notice during the Association’s business hours. In Declarant’s discretion, such\\nArchitectural Guidelines may be Recorded, in which event the Recorded version, as it may be\\namended, shall control in the event of any dispute as to which version of the Architectural\\nGuidelines was in effect at any particular time.\\n\\n(b) Procedures. Except as the Architectural Guidelines otherwise specifically\\nprovide, no activity described in Section 5.1 shall commence on any Unit until an application for\\napproval has been submitted to and approved by the Reviewer. Such application shall include\\nplans and specifications showing site layout, exterior elevations, exterior materials and colors,\\nlandscaping, drainage, exterior lighting, irrigation, and other features of proposed construction,\\nas applicable. The Architectural Guidelines and the Reviewer may require the submission of\\nsuch additional information as deemed necessary to consider any application.\\n\\nIn reviewing each submission, the Reviewer may consider any factors it deems relevant,\\n\\nWCSR 32011673v6\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nincluding, without limitation, harmony of external design with surrounding structures and\\nenvironment. Decisions may be based solely on aesthetic considerations. Each Owner\\nacknowledges that determinations as to such matters are purely subjective and opinions may vary\\nas to the desirability or attractiveness of particular improvements. Subject to Declarant’s veto\\npower described below, the Reviewer shall have the sole discretion to make final, conclusive,\\nand binding determinations on matters of aesthetic judgment. Such determinations shall not be\\nsubject to review so long as they are made in good faith and in accordance with the procedures\\ndescribed in this Article.\\n\\nThe Reviewer shall make a determination on each application within sixty (60) days after\\nreceipt of a completed application and all required information. The Reviewer may (i) approve\\nthe application, with or without conditions; (ii) approve a portion of the application and\\ndisapprove other portions; or (iii) disapprove the application or (iv) request further or additional\\ninformation. The Reviewer may, but shall not be obligated to, specify the reasons for any\\nobjections or offer suggestions for curing any objections.\\n\\nUntil expiration of Declarant’s rights under this Article, the ARC shall notify Declarant\\nin writing within three (3) business days after the ARC has approved an application. The notice\\nshall be accompanied by a copy of the application and any additional information which\\nDeclarant may require. Declarant shall have ten (10) days after receipt of such notice to veto any\\nsuch action, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the ARC and the applicant.\\n\\nIn any event, the Reviewer shall notify the applicant in writing of a final determination\\nwithin forty-five (45) days after its receipt of a completed application and all required\\ninformation. In the event that the Reviewer fails to respond in a timely manner, approval shall\\nbe deemed to have been given, subject to Declarant’s veto right. However, no approval, whether\\nexpressly granted or deemed granted pursuant to the foregoing, shall be inconsistent with the\\nArchitectural Guidelines unless the Reviewer has granted a variance pursuant to Section 5.5.\\n\\nNotice shall be deemed to have been given at the time the envelope containing the\\nresponse is deposited with the U.S. Postal Service or sent via email to the email address provided\\nby the owner. Personal delivery of such written notice shall, however, be sufficient and shalt be\\ndeemed to have been given at the time of delivery to the applicant.\\n\\nIf construction does not commence on a project for which plans have been approved\\nwithin six (6) months after the date of approval, such approval shall be deemed withdrawn, and it\\nshall be necessary for the Owner to reapply for approval before commencing construction of any\\nproposed improvements. Once construction is commenced, it shall be diligently pursued to\\ncompletion. All work shall be completed within one year of commencement unless otherwise\\nspecified in the notice of approval or unless the Reviewer grants an extension in writing, which it\\nshall not be obligated to do. If approved work is not completed within the required time, it shall\\nbe considered nonconforming and shall be subject to enforcement action by the Association,\\nDeclarant, or any aggrieved Owner. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to the\\nDeclarant during the Declarant Control Period.\\n\\nThe Reviewer may by resolution exempt certain activities from the application and\\n\\nWCSR 32011673v6\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\napproval requirements of this Article, provided such activities are undertaken in strict\\ncompliance with the requirements of such resolution.\\n\\n5.4. No Waiver of Future Approvals.\\n\\nEach Owner acknowledges that the Persons reviewing applications under this Article will\\nchange from time to time and that opinions on aesthetic matters, as well as interpretation and\\napplication of the Architectural Guidelines, may vary accordingly. In addition, each Owner\\nacknowledges that it may not always be possible to identify objectionable features until work is\\ncompleted, in which case it may be unreasonable to require changes to the improvements\\ninvolved, but the Reviewer may refuse to approve similar proposals in the future. Approval of\\napplications or plans, or in connection with any other matter requiring approval, shall not\\nconstitute a binding precedent in any other matter or waiver of the right to withhold approval as\\nto any similar applications, plans, or other matters subsequently or additionally submitted for\\napproval.\\n\\n5.5. Variances.\\n\\nThe Reviewer may authorize variances from compliance with any of its guidelines and\\nprocedures when circumstances such as topography, natural obstructions, hardship, or aesthetic\\nor environmental considerations require, but only in accordance with duly adopted rules and\\nregulations. No variance shall (a) be effective unless in writing; (b) be contrary to this\\nDeclaration; or (c) estop the Reviewer from denying a variance in other circumstances. For\\npurposes of this Section, the inability to obtain approval of any governmental agency, the\\nissuance of any permit, or the terms of any financing shall not be considered a hardship\\nwarranting a variance.\\n\\n5.6. Limitation of Liability.\\n\\nThe standards and procedures this Article establishes are intended as a mechanism for\\nmaintaining and enhancing the overall aesthetics of the Community; they do not create any duty\\nto any Person. Review and approval of any application pursuant to this Article may be based on\\naesthetic considerations only. The Reviewer shall not bear any responsibility for ensuring (a) the\\nstructural integrity or soundness of approved construction or modifications; (b) compliance with\\nbuilding codes and other governmental requirements; (c) that Units are of comparable quality,\\nvalue, size, or of similar design, aesthetically pleasing, or otherwise acceptable to neighboring\\nproperty owners; (d) that views from any other Units or the Area of Common Responsibility are\\nprotected; or (e) that no defects exist in approved construction.\\n\\nDeclarant, the Association, the Board, any committee, or any member of any of the\\nforegoing shall not be held lable for soil conditions, drainage, or other general site work; any\\ndefects in plans revised or approved hereunder; any loss or damage arising out of the actions,\\ninaction, integrity, financial condition, or quality of work of any contractor or its subcontractors,\\nemployees, or agents; or any injury, damages, or loss arising out of the manner or quality of\\napproved construction on or modifications to any Unit. In all matters, the Association shall\\ndefend and indemnify the Board, the ARC, and any members thereof as provided in Article VIII.\\n\\nWCSR 32011673Vv6\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n5.7. Certificate of Compliance.\\n\\nAny Owner may request that the Reviewer issue a certificate of architectural compliance\\ncertifying that such Owner’s Unit has no known violations of this Article or the Architectural\\nGuidelines. The Association shall either grant or deny such request within thirty (30) days after\\nreceipt of a written request and may charge a reasonable administrative fee for issuing such\\ncertificates. Issuance of such a certificate shall estop the Association from taking enforcement\\naction with respect to any condition as to which the Association had notice as of the date of such\\ncertificate.\\n\\n5.8. | View Impairment.\\n\\nNeither Declarant nor the Association guarantee or represent that any view over and\\nacross any portion of the Community or any adjacent property will be preserved without\\nimpairment. Any additions or changes, whether occurring in the course of developing or\\nmaintaining the Community, may diminish or obstruct any view from Units and any express or\\nimplied easements for view purposes or for the passage of light and air are hereby expressly\\ndisclaimed.\\n\\nArticle VI Maintenance and Repair\\n6.1. | Maintenance of Units.\\n\\nThe maintenance of all Units shall be done in accordance with the Governing Documents\\napplicable to such Unit. Each Owner shall maintain his or her Unit and all landscaping,\\nirrigation systems, and other improvements comprising the Unit in a manner consistent with the\\nGoverning Documents, the Community-Wide Standard, and all applicable covenants unless the\\nAssociation assumes such maintenance responsibility pursuant to any Supplemental Declaration\\nor other declaration of covenants applicable to such Unit.\\n\\nExcept as may be provided in a Supplemental Declaration, each Owner shall also be\\nresponsible for maintaining and irrigating the landscaping within that portion of any adjacent\\nCommon Area or public right-of-way lying between the Unit boundary and any wall, fence, or\\ncurb located on the Common Area or right-of-way within 10 feet of the Unit boundary; however,\\nthere shall be no right to remove trees, shrubs, or similar vegetation from this area without prior\\napproval pursuant to Article V.\\n\\n6.2. Responsibility for Repair and Replacement.\\n\\nUnless the Governing Documents or other instruments creating and assigning\\nmaintenance responsibility specifically provide otherwise, responsibility for maintenance shall\\ninclude responsibility for repair and replacement as necessary to maintain the property to a level\\nconsistent with the Community-Wide Standard.\\n\\nBy virtue of taking title to a Unit, each Owner covenants and agrees with all other\\n\\nWCSR 32011673v6\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nze\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nOwners and with the Association to carry property insurance for the full replacement cost of all\\ninsurable improvements on his or her Unit, less a reasonable deductible. If the Association\\nassumes responsibility for obtaining any insurance coverage on behalf of Owners (but nothing\\nherein shall be deemed to impose or imply any obligation upon the Association to obtain such\\ninsurance coverage), the premiums for such insurance shall be levied as a Specific Assessment\\nagainst the benefited Unit and the Owner pursuant to Section 9.3.\\n\\nEach Owner further covenants and agrees that in the event of damage to or destruction of\\nstructures on or comprising his Unit, the Owner shall proceed promptly to repair or to reconstruct\\nsuch structures in a manner consistent with the original construction or such other plans and\\nspecifications as are approved in accordance with Article V. Alternatively, the Owner shall clear\\nthe damaged portions of the Unit and maintain the Unit in a neat and attractive, landscaped\\ncondition consistent with the Community-Wide Standard.

If the proceeds of insurance are\\ninsufficient to pay the estimated or actual cost of such repair or reconstruction, then the Board,\\npursuant to Section 9.2, may levy in advance a Special Assessment sufficient to provide funds to\\npay such estimated or actual costs of repair or reconstruction. Such assessment shall be allocated\\nand collected as provided in Article IX. Further levies may be made in like manner if the\\namounts collected prove insufficient to complete the repair or reconstruction. The insurance\\nproceeds held by the Association and the amounts received from the Assessments provided for in\\nArticle IX constitute a fund for the payment for costs of repair or reconstruction after casualty. If\\na balance exists after payment of all costs of such repair or reconstruction, such balance shall be\\ndistributed to the Owners of the Units in proportion to the contributions made by each Owner to\\nthe Association.\\n\\nIf a decision is made not to restore the damaged improvements and no alternative\\nimprovements are authorized, the Association shall clear the affected property of all debris and\\nruins and thereafter shall maintain such improvements in a neat and attractive, landscaped\\ncondition consistent with the Community-Wide Standard. The cost of removal and landscaping\\nshall be paid for with insurance proceeds.

Nothing herein shall be construed as a representation by Declarant or the\\nAssociation as to what, if any, services shall be provided. In addition, the Board, in its\\ndiscretion, shall be permitted to modify or cancel existing services provided unless otherwise\\nrequired by the Governing Documents.

Base Assessments; Allocation of Common Expenses and Budgeting.\\n\\nUntil the Association first levies Assessments, Declarant shall be responsible for all\\nCommon Expenses. Thereafter, Assessments for Common Expenses shall be levied at least\\nannually in accordance with this Article.\\n\\nAt least forty-five (45) days before the beginning of each fiscal year, the Board shall\\nprepare and approve a budget of the estimated Common Expenses for the coming year. The\\nbudget shall include any contributions to be made to a reserve fund for repair and replacement\\nof capital assets, based on a separate reserve budget which takes into account the number and\\nnature of replaceable assets, the expected life of each asset, and each asset’s expected repair or\\nreplacement cost. The budget shall reflect the sources and estimated amounts of funds to cover\\nsuch expenses, which may include any surplus to be applied from prior years, any income\\nexpected from sources other than Assessments levied against the Units, and the amount to be\\ngenerated through the levy of Base Assessments and Special Assessments against the Units, as\\n\\n26\\nWCSR 3201 1673v6\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nauthorized in Section 9.5.\\n\\nThe Association is hereby authorized to levy Base Assessments equally against all Units\\nsubject to assessment under Section 9.5 to fund the Common Expenses. In determining the Base\\nAssessment rate per Unit, the Board may consider any assessment income expected to be\\ngenerated from any additional Units reasonably anticipated to become subject to assessment\\nduring the fiscal year.\\n\\nDeclarant may, but shall not be obligated to, reduce the Base Assessment for any fiscal\\nyear by paying any deficit between the Common Expenses and Association funds collected\\npursuant to the current year’s budget, or any portion of any such deficit (in addition to any\\namounts paid by Declarant under Section 9.7), which may be a contribution, an advance against\\nfuture Assessments due from Declarant, or a loan, as may be determined by Declarant in its sole\\nand exclusive discretion. Any such deficit payment shall be disclosed as a line item in the\\nincome portion of the budget. Payment of such deficit, or portion thereof, in any year shall not\\nobligate Declarant to continue payment of such deficit in future years, unless otherwise provided\\nin a written agreement between the Association and Declarant.\\n\\n9.2. Special Assessments.\\n\\nIn addition to other authorized Assessments, the Association may levy Special\\nAssessments to cover unbudgeted expenses or expenses in excess of those budgeted. Any such\\nSpecial Assessment may be levied against the entire membership. Except as otherwise\\nspecifically provided in this Declaration, any Special Assessment shall require the affirmative\\nvote or written consent of a majority of the Board and the consent of Declarant during the\\nDeclarant Control Period. Special Assessments shall be payable in such manner and at such\\ntimes as determined by the Board and may be payable in installments extending beyond the\\nfiscal year in which the Special Assessment is approved.\\n\\n9.3. Specific Assessments.\\n\\nThe Association acting by and through its Board shall have the power to levy Specific\\nAssessments against a particular Unit as follows:\\n\\n(a) to cover the costs, including overhead and administrative costs, of providing\\nservices to Units upon request of an Owner pursuant to any menu of special services which the\\nAssociation may offer (which might include items identified in Section 8.9). The Association\\nmay levy Specific Assessments for special services in advance of the provision of the requested\\nservice; and\\n\\n(b) to cover costs incurred in bringing the Unit into compliance with the Governing\\nDocuments, or costs incurred as a consequence of the conduct of the Owner or occupants of the\\nUnit, their agents, contractors, employees, licensees, invitees, or guests; provided, the Board\\nshall give the Unit Owner prior written notice and an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance\\nwith the Bylaws, before levying any Specific Assessment under this subsection (b).\\n\\n27\\nWCSR 32011673v6\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n9.4. Neighborhood Assessments.\\n\\nThe Association may levy Assessments against the property in a particular Neighborhood\\nto fund actual and estimated expenses, including adequate reserves, incurred by the Association\\nfor the primary benefit of property within such Neighborhood. Neighborhood Assessments shall\\nbe levied as specifically budgeted from time to time by the Board of Directors for expense items\\nsuch as maintenance, garbage collection, insurance, or special services. In addition, the Board\\nshall levy a Neighborhood Assessment upon the request of the Owners holding at least sixty-\\nseven percent (67%) of the total association vote applicable to Units within a Neighborhood.\\n\\n9.5. Authority To Assess Owners: Time of Payment.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeclarant hereby establishes and the Association is hereby authorized to levy\\nAssessments as provided for in this Article and elsewhere in the Governing Documents. The\\nobligation to pay Assessments shall commence as to each Unit on the day of the sale of a Unit to\\nan owner other than Declarant, and shall be prorated at the closing. The first annual Base\\nAssessment levied on each Unit shall be adjusted according to the number of days remaining in\\nthe fiscal year at the time Assessments commence on the Unit, with the full amount of prorated\\nBase Assessment owing for the remainder of the fiscal year to be collected at the closing.\\n\\nAssessments shall be paid in such manner and on such dates as the Board may establish.\\nThe Board may require advance payment of Assessments at closing of the transfer of title to a\\nUnit and impose special requirements for Owners with a history of delinquent payment. If the\\nBoard so elects, Assessments may be paid in annual, semi-annual, quarterly or monthly\\ninstallments. Unless the Board provides otherwise, the Base Assessment shall be due and\\npayable in advance on the first day of each fiscal year. If any Owner is delinquent in paying any\\nAssessments or other charges levied on his Unit, the Board may require the outstanding balance\\non all Assessments to be paid in full immediately.\\n\\n9.6. Personal Obligation for Assessments.\\n\\nEach Owner, by accepting a deed or entering into a Recorded contract of sale for any\\nportion of the Community, covenants and agrees to pay all Assessments authorized in the\\nGoverning Documents. All Assessments, together with interest (computed from its due date at a\\nrate of ten percent (10%) per annum or such higher rate as the Board may establish, subject to\\nthe limitations of South Carolina law), late charges as determined by Board resolution, costs, and\\nreasonable attorneys’ fees, shall be each Owner’s personal obligation and a lien upon each Unit\\nuntil paid in full. Upon a transfer of title to a Unit, the grantee shall be jointly and severally\\nliable for any Assessments and other charges due at the time of conveyance.\\n\\nThe Board’s failure to fix assessment amounts or rates or to deliver or mail each Owner\\nan assessment notice shall not be deemed a waiver, modification, or a release of any Owner from\\nthe obligation to pay Assessments. In such event, each Owner shall continue to pay Base\\nAssessments on the same basis as during the last year for which an assessment was made, if any,\\nuntil a new assessment is levied, at which time the Association may retroactively assess any\\nshortfalls in collections.\\n\\n28\\nWCSR 3201 1673v6\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nNo Owner may exempt himself from liability for Assessments by non-use of Area of\\nCommon Responsibility, abandonment of his or her Unit, or any other means. The obligation to\\npay Assessments is a separate and independent covenant on the part of each Owner. No\\ndiminution or abatement of Assessments or set-off shall be claimed or allowed for any alleged\\nfailure of the Association or Board to take some action or perform some function required of it,\\nor for inconvenience or discomfort arising from the making of repairs or improvements, or from\\nany other action it takes.\\n\\n9.7. Budget Deficits During Declarant Control.\\nDuring the Declarant Control Period, Declarant may (but shall not be required to):\\n\\n(a) Advance funds to the Association sufficient to satisfy the deficit, if any, between\\nthe Association’s actual operating expenses and the sum of the Base, Special, Neighborhood, and\\nSpecific Assessments collected by the Association in any fiscal year. Such advances shall, upon\\nrequest of Declarant, be evidenced by promissory notes from the Association in favor of\\nDeclarant. Declarant’s failure to obtain a promissory note shall not invalidate the debt;\\n\\n(b) Cause the Association to borrow any amount from a third party at the then\\nprevailing rates for such a loan in the local area of the Community. Declarant, in its sole\\ndiscretion, may guarantee repayment of such loan, if required by the lending institution, but no\\nMortgage secured by the Common Area or any of the improvements maintained by the\\nAssociation shall be given in connection with such loan; or\\n\\n(c) Acquire property for, or provide services to, the Association or the Area of\\nCommon Responsibility. Declarant shall designate the value of the property or the services\\nprovided, and such amounts, at Declarant’s request, shall be evidenced by a promissory note.\\nFailure to obtain a promissory note shall not invalidate the obligation referred to in this Section.\\n\\n9.8. Statement of Account.\\n\\nUpon written request of any Member, Mortgagee, prospective Mortgagee, or prospective\\npurchaser of a Unit, the Association shall issue a written statement setting forth the amount of\\nthe unpaid Assessments, if any, with respect to such Unit, the amount of the current periodic\\nassessment and the date on which such assessment becomes or became due, and any credit for\\nadvanced payments or prepaid items. Such statement shall be delivered to the requesting Person\\npersonally or fax or by email or USPS. The Association may require the payment of a\\nreasonable processing fee for issuance of such statement.\\n\\nSuch statement shall bind the Association in favor of Persons who rely upon it in good\\nfaith. Provided such request is made in writing, if the request for a statement of account is not\\nprocessed within 14 days of receipt of the request, all unpaid Assessments that became due\\nbefore the date of making such request shall be subordinate to the lien of a Mortgagee that\\nacquired its interest after requesting such statement.\\n\\n29\\nWCSR 3201 1673v6\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n9.9. Lien for Assessments.\\n\\nSubject to the limitations of any other applicable provisions of South Carolina law, the\\nAssociation shall have a statutory lien against each Unit to secure payment of delinquent\\nAssessments, as well as interest, late charges, and costs of collection (including attorneys’ fees).\\nSuch lien shall be perfected upon the Recordation of this Declaration.\\n\\nSuch lien shall be superior to all other liens, except (a) the liens of all taxes, bonds,\\nAssessments, and other levies which by law would be superior; (b) the lien or charge of any\\nRecorded First Mortgage made in good faith and for value; and (c) labor or mechanic’s liens, to\\nthe extent required by law.\\n\\nSuch lien, when delinquent, may be enforced in the same manner as provided for the\\nforeclosure of Mortgages under South Carolina law. All such costs and expenses of any such\\nforeclosure shall be secured by the lien being foreclosed.\\n\\nThe Association may bid for the Unit, as applicable, at the foreclosure sale and acquire,\\nhold, lease, mortgage, and convey the Unit. While a Unit is owned by the Association following\\nforeclosure: (a) no right to vote shall be exercised on its behalf; (b) no assessment shall be levied\\non it; and (c) each other Unit shall be charged, in addition to its usual assessment, its pro rata\\nshare of the assessment that would have been charged to the foreclosed Unit had the Association\\nnot acquired it. The Association may sue for unpaid Assessments and other charges authorized\\nhereunder without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the same.\\n\\nThe sale or transfer of any Unit shall not affect the assessment lien or relieve such Unit\\nfrom the lien for any subsequent Assessments. However, the sale or transfer of any Unit\\npursuant to foreclosure of the First Mortgage shall extinguish the lien as to any installments of\\nsuch Assessments due prior to the Mortgagee’s foreclosure, except as otherwise provided in this\\nSection. Uncollected Assessments shall be deemed Common Expenses collectible from Owners\\nof all Units subject to assessment under Section 9.5, including such acquirer, its successors, and\\nassigns. The subsequent Owner of the foreclosed Unit shall not be personally liable for\\nAssessments on such Unit due prior to such acquisition of title. Such unpaid Assessments shall\\nbe deemed to be Common Expenses collectible from Owners of all Units subject to assessment\\nunder Section 9.5, including such acquirer, its successors, and assigns.\\n\\n9.10. Exempt Property.\\n\\nThe following property shall be exempt from payment of Base Assessments, Specific\\nAssessments, Neighborhood Assessments and Special Assessments: (a) all Common Area and\\nsuch portions of the property owned by Declarant as are included in the Area of Common\\nResponsibility; and (b) any property dedicated to and accepted by any governmental authority or\\npublic utility; and (c) any and all property owned by the Declarant.\\n\\n9.11.

This amount shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, the annual Base\\nAssessment and shall not be considered an advance payment of such assessment. This amount\\nshall be deposited into the purchase and sales escrow and disbursed therefrom to the Association.\\nThe Association shall deposit this amount into the operating account of the Association for use in\\ncovering operating expenses and other expenses incurred by the Association pursuant to this\\nDeclaration and the By-Laws, including but not limited to expenses incurred by Declarant in\\nproviding infrastructure or other Common Area to the Community. This amount may be\\nincreased or decreased in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Board.\\n\\n9.12 Transfer Fee on Resales\\n\\nEach time a Unit is sold, transferred or otherwise conveyed to a new Owner, the\\npurchaser of the Unit shall pay to the Association at the time of settlement a transfer fee in the\\namount of one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the sales price. This amount shall be deposited\\ninto the purchase and sales escrow and disbursed therefrom to the Association. The Association\\nshall deposit this amount into the operating account of the Association for any legitimate\\npurposes as the Board of Directors may determine, but said amounts shall not be considered as\\nadvance payments of regular Assessments. This provision shall not apply to the following\\ntransfers: (i) involuntary conveyances; (ii) conveyances pursuant to testacy or as a part of the\\nOwner’s estate planning; or (ii!) conveyances between family members when no consideration is\\npaid.\\n\\nArticle X Expansion of the Community\\n\\n10.1.

Such Supplemental Declaration shall not require the Members’\\nconsent but shall require the consent of the owner of such property, if other than Declarant. Any\\nsuch annexation shall be effective upon the Recording of such Supplemental Declaration unless\\notherwise provided therein.\\n\\n10.2.

If the property is Common Area, the Association shall consent to such withdrawal\\nupon Declarant’s request.\\n\\n10.4. Additional Covenants and Easements.\\n\\nDuring the Declarant Control Period, Declarant unilaterally may subject any portion of\\nthe Property to additional covenants, restrictions and easements. Such additional covenants,\\nrestrictions and easements shall be set forth in a Supplemental Declaration filed either concurrent\\nwith or after the subjection of the property and shall require the written consent of the owner(s)\\nof such property, if other than Declarant. Any such Supplemental Declaration may supplement,\\ncreate exceptions to, or otherwise modify the terms of this Declaration as it applies to the subject\\nproperty in order to reflect the different character and intended use of such property.\\n\\n10.5. Effect of Filing Supplemental Declaration.\\n\\nA Supplemental Declaration shall be effective upon Recording unless such Supplemental\\nDeclaration specifies otherwise. On the effective date of the Supplemental Declaration, any\\nAdditional Property shall be assigned voting rights in the Association and assessment liability in\\naccordance with the provisions of this Declaration.\\n\\n10.6.

Claimant shall submit a Claim to arbitration under these Rules by giving written\\nnotice to all other Parties stating plainly and concisely the nature of the Claim, the remedy\\nsought and Claimant’s submission of the Claim to arbitration (“Arbitration Notice”).\\n\\n2. ° The Parties shall select arbitrators (“Party Appointed Arbitrators”) as follows: all\\nthe Claimants shall agree upon one Party Appointed Arbitrator, and all the Respondents shall\\nagree upon one Party Appointed Arbitrator. The Party Appointed Arbitrators shall, by\\nagreement, select one neutral arbitrator (“Neutral”) so that the total arbitration panel (“Panel”)\\nhas three arbitrators.\\n\\n3. If the Panel is not selected under Rule 2 within forty-five (45) days from the date of\\nthe Arbitration Notice, any party may notify the nearest chapter of The Community Association\\nInstitute, for any dispute arising under the Governing Documents, or the American Arbitration\\nAssociation, or such other independent body providing arbitration services, for any dispute\\nrelating to the design or construction of improvements on the Properties, which shall appoint one\\nNeutral (“Appointed Neutral”), notifying the Appointed Neutral and all! Parties in writing of such\\nappointment. The Appointed Neutral shall thereafter be the sole arbitrator and any Party\\nAppointed Arbitrators or their designees shall have no further duties involving the arbitration\\nproceedings.\\n\\n4. No person may serve as a Neutral in any arbitration in which that person has any\\nfinancial or personal interest in the result of the arbitration. Any person designated as a Neutral\\nor Appointed Neutral shall immediately disclose in writing to all Parties any circumstance likely\\nto affect impartiality, including any bias or financial or personal interest in the outcome of the\\narbitration (“Bias Disclosure”). If any Party objects to the service of any Neutral or Appointed\\nNeutral after receipt of that Neutral’s Bias Disclosure, such Neutral or Appointed Neutral shall\\nbe replaced in the same manner in which that Neutral or Appointed Neutral was selected.\\n\\n5. The Appointed Neutral or Neutral, as the case may be, (“Arbitrator”) shall fix the\\ndate, time, and place for the hearing. The place of the hearing shall be within Oyster Point\\nunless otherwise agreed by the Parties. In fixing the date of the hearing, or in continuing a\\nhearing, the Arbitrator shall take into consideration the amount of time reasonably required to\\ndetermine Claimant’s damages accurately.\\n\\n6. | Any Party may be represented by an attorney or other authorized representative\\nthroughout the arbitration proceedings. In the event the Respondent fails to participate in the\\narbitration proceeding, the Arbitrator may not enter an Award by default, but shall hear\\nClaimant’s case and decide accordingly.\\n\\n7. All persons who, in the judgment of the Arbitrator, have a direct interest in the\\n\\narbitration are entitled to attend hearings. The Arbitrator shall determine any relevant legal\\nissues, including whether all indispensable parties are Bound Parties or whether the claim is\\n\\nWCSR 32011673v6\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nbarred by the statute of limitations.\\n\\n8. The hearing shall be conducted in whatever manner will, in the Arbitrator’s\\njudgment, most fairly and expeditiously permit the full presentation of the evidence and\\narguments of the Parties. The Arbitrator may issue such orders as he or she deems necessary to\\nsafeguard rights of the Parties in the dispute without prejudice to the rights of the Parties or the\\nfinal determination of the dispute.\\n\\n9. If the Arbitrator decides that he or she has insufficient expertise to determine a\\nrelevant issue raised during arbitration, the Arbitrator may retain the services of an independent\\nexpert who will assist the Arbitrator in making the necessary determination. The scope of such\\nprofessional’s assistance shall be determined by the Arbitrator in the his or her own discretion.\\nSuch independent professional must not have any bias or financial or personal interest in the\\noutcome of the arbitration and shail immediately notify the Parties of any such bias or interest by\\ndelivering a Bias Disclosure to the Parties. If any Party objects to the service of any professional\\nafter receipt of a Bias Disclosure, such professional shall be replaced by another independent\\nlicensed professional selected by the Arbitrator.\\n\\n10. No formal discovery shall be conducted in the absence of order of the Arbitrator or\\nexpress written agreement among all the Parties. The only evidence to be presented at the\\nhearing shall be that which is disclosed to all Parties at least 30 days prior to the hearing;\\nhowever, no Party shall deliberately withhold or refuse to disclose any evidence which is\\nrelevant and material to the Claim and is not otherwise privileged. The Parties may offer such\\nevidence as is relevant and material to the Claim and shall produce such additional evidence as\\nthe Arbitrator may deem necessary to an understanding and determination of the Claim. The\\nArbitrator shall be the sole judge of the relevance and materiality of any evidence offered, and\\nconformity to the legal rules of evidence shall not be necessary. The Arbitrator shall be\\nauthorized, but not required, to administer oaths to witnesses.\\n\\n11. The Arbitrator shall declare the hearings closed when he or she is satisfied the\\nrecord is complete.\\n\\n12. There will be no post hearing briefs.\\n\\n13. The Award shall be rendered immediately following the close of the hearing, if\\npossible, and no later than 14 days from the close of the hearing, unless otherwise agreed by the\\nParties. The Award shall be in writing, signed by the Arbitrator, and acknowledged before a\\nnotary public. If the Arbitrator believes an opinion is necessary, it shall be in summary form.\\n\\n14. If there is more than one arbitrator, all decisions of the Panel, including the\\nAward, shall be by majority vote. Each Party agrees to accept as legal delivery of the Award the\\ndeposit of a true copy in the mail addressed to that Party or its attorney at the address\\ncommunicated to the Arbitrator at the hearing.\\n\\nWCSR 32011673v6\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nRECORDER\\'S PAGE &\\n\\nNOTE: This page MUST remain WA\\nwith the original document\\n\\n   \\n \\n\\nFiled By:\\nWOMBLE CARLYLE SANDRIDGE & RICE\\n5 EXCHANGE STREET\\nPO BOX 999\\nCHARLESTON SC 29401\\n\\n      \\n     \\n   \\n\\nMAKER: # of sats. ___] # of References:\\n\\nD R HORTON INC\\n\\n \\n\\nDate:| March 13,2014 _]\\nTime: 1:29:48 PM\\n\\nBook Pag DocType\\n\\nage\\n[0303 | 380 _ |\\n\\nCharlie Lybrand, Register\\nCharleston County, SC\\n\\n# of Pages:\\n\\nRecording Fee} $ 10.00\\n\\nExtra Reference Cost\\n\\nExtra Pages| 3 80.00\\n\\n \\n\\nPostage| § |\\nchattel] $_—_|\\nTOTAL 90.00\\n\\nDRAWER\\n\\nCLERK LRR\\n\\n03/13/2014\\nRecorded Date # Pgs\\n\\nIACI\\n\\n13:29:48\\n\\nRECIPIENT: .\\nA 0M\\nI II I\\n\\n843-958-4800 101 MEETING STREET CHARLESTON, SC 29401\\n\\nRecorded Time\\n\\nwww.charlestoncounty.org\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n', 'Document_15': \"(Printed Text):\\n \\n\\n5473\\n\\nLAMA 229\\n\\nDrafted by and retum to:\\n\\nThomas L.

All replacements and additions shall also be covered by this Security Instrument. All of\\nthe foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument as the “Property.”\\n\\nBORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seised of the estate hereby conveyed and has the right to grant\\nand convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of record. Borrower warrants\\nand will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands, subject to any encumbrances of record.\\n\\nTHIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform covenants with\\nlimited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real property.\\n\\nUNIFORM COVENANTS, Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:\\n\\n1. Payment of Principal, Interest, Escrow Items, Prepayment Charges, and Late Charges. Borrower shall pay\\nwhen due the principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and any prepayment charges and late charges\\ndue under the Note.

If each Periodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date,\\n\\nthen Lender need not pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes\\npayment to bring the Loan current. If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either\\napply such funds or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be applied to the outstanding principal\\nbalance under the Note immediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or claim which Borrower might have now or in the\\nfuture against Lender shall relieve Borrower from making payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument or\\nperforming the covenants and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.\\n\\n2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, all payments accepted\\nand applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority: (a) interest due under the Note: (b) principal\\ndue under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3. Such payments shall be applied to each Periodic Payment in the\\norder in which it became due. Any remaining amounts shail be applied first to late charges, second to any other amounts\\ndue under this Security Instrument, and then to reduce the principal balance of the Note. .\\n\\nIf Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a sufficient amount\\nto pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and the late charge. If more than\\none Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received from Borrower to the repayment of the\\nPeriodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each payment can be paid in full. To the extent that any excess exists after\\nthe payment is applied to the full payment of one or more Periodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any late\\ncharges due. Voluntary prepayments shall be applied first to any prepayment charges and then as described in the\\nNote.\\n\\nAny application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under the Note shall\\nnot extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments.\\n\\n3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due under the Note,\\nuntil the Note is paid in full, a sum (the “Funds”) to provide for payment of amounts due for: (a) taxes and assessments\\nand other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a lien or encumbrance on the Property; (b)\\nleasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; (c) premiums for any and all insurance required by Lender\\nunder Section 5, and (d) Mortgage Insurance premiums, if any, or any sums payable by Borrower to Lender in lieu of\\nthe payment of Mortgage Insurance premiums in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. These items are called\\n“Escrow Items.” At origination or at any time during the term of the Loan, Lender may require that Community Association\\nDues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an\\nEscrow Item. Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower\\nshall pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives Borrower\\'s obligation to pay the Funds for any or\\nall Escrow Items. Lender may waive Borrower\\'s obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at any time.\\nAny such waiver may only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable,\\nthe amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires,\\nshall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower\\'s\\nobligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all purposes be deemed to be a covenant and\\nagreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase “covenant and agreement” is used in Section 9. If\\nBorrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the amount due for\\nan Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be\\nobligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow\\nitems at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section 15 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to\\nLender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.\\n\\nLender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to apply the Funds at\\nthe time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can require under RESPA. Lender\\nshall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and reasonable estimates of expenditures of future\\nEscrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable Law.\\n\\nThe Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or entity\\n(including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender\\nshall apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time specified under RESPA. Lender shall not charge\\nBorrower for holding and applying the Funds, annually analyzing the escrow account, or verifying the Escrow Items,\\nunless Lender pays Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless\\nan agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender shall not be required\\nto pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest\\nshall be paid on the Funds. Lender shall give to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds as required\\nby RESPA.\\n\\nIf there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account to Borrower for the\\nexcess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender\\nshall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the\\nshortage in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly payments. If there is a deficiency of Funds held\\nin escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to\\nLender the amount necessary to make up the deficiency in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly\\npayments.\\n\\nUpon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly refund to Borrower any\\nFunds held by Lender.\\n\\n4. Charges; Liens. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions attributable to the\\nProperty which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property,\\nif any, and Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any. To the extent that these items\\nare Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them in the manner provided in Section 3.\\n\\nBorrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless Borrower: (a)\\nagrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to Lender, but only so long\\nas Borrower is performing such agreement; (b) contests the lien in good faith by, or defends against enforcement of the\\n\\nSOUTH CAROLINA--Single Family-Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT Form 3041 1/01 a\\nEllie Mae, Inc.

If Lender determines that any part\\nof the Property is subject to a lien which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a\\nnotice identifying the lien. Within 10 days of the date on which that notice is given, Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take\\none or more of the actions set forth above in this Section 4.\\n\\nLender may require Borrower to pay a one-time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or reporting service used\\nby Lender in connection with this Loan.\\n\\n5. Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on the Property\\ninsured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term “extended coverage,” and any other hazards including,\\nbut not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in\\nthe amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to\\nthe preceding sentences can change during the term of the Loan. The insurance carrier providing the insurance shall\\nbe chosen by Borrower subject to Lender\\'s right to disapprove Borrower\\'s choice, which right shall not be exercised\\nunreasonably. Lender may require Borrower to pay, in connection with this Loan, either: (a) a one-time charge for flood\\nzone determination, certification and tracking services; or (b) a one-time charge for flood zone determination and\\ncertification services and subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which reasonably might\\naffect such determination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by\\nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone determination resulting\\nfrom an objection by Borrower.\\n\\nIf Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at\\nLender\\'s option and Borrower\\'s expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount of\\ncoverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might not protect Borrower, Borrower’s equity in\\nthe Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard or liability and might provide greater or lesser\\ncoverage than was previously in effect. Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained\\nmight significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender\\nunder this Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall\\nbear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from\\nLender to Borrower requesting payment.\\n\\nAll insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender\\'s right to\\ndisapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as\\nan additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and renewal certificates. If Lender requires,\\nBorrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form\\nof insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such policy shall\\ninclude a standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.\\n\\nIn the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender may make proof\\nof loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree in writing, any insurance\\nproceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall be applied to restoration or repair of\\nthe Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender\\'s security is not lessened. During such repair\\nand restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity\\nto inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender\\'s satisfaction, provided that such inspection\\nshall be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in\\na series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law\\nrequires interest to be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or\\nearnings on such proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower shall not be paid out\\nof the insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower. If the restoration or repair is not economically\\nfeasible or Lender\\'s security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this\\nSecurity Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall\\nbe applied in the order provided for in Section 2.\\n\\nIf Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance claim and related\\nmatters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the insurance carrier has offered to\\nsettle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day period will begin when the notice is given.\\nIn either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section 22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender\\n(a) Borrower’s rights to any insurance proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note or this\\nSecurity Instrument, and (b) any other of Borrower\\'s rights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums\\npaid by Borrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to the\\ncoverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property or to pay\\namounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.\\n\\n6. Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower\\'s principal residence within\\n60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower\\'s principal\\nresidence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, which consent\\nshall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower\\'s control.\\n\\n7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower shall not destroy,\\ndamage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the Property. Whether or not\\nBorrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain the Property in order to prevent the Property from\\ndeteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless it is determined pursuant to Section 5 that repair or\\nrestoration is not economically feasible, Borrower shall promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further\\ndeterioration or damage. If insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid in connection with damage to, or the taking\\nof, the Property, Borrower shall be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender has released\\nproceeds for such purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in\\na series of progress payments as the work is completed. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient\\n\\nSOUTH CAROLINA--Single Family--Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT —— Form 3041 1/01 Initials: Ke\\nEllie Mae, Inc.

Lender shall give Borrower notice at the time of\\nor prior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.\\n\\n8. Borrower’s Loan Application. Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application process, Borrower\\nor any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower’s knowledge or consent gave materially\\nfalse, misteading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with material information)\\nin connection with the Loan. Material representations include, but are not limited to, representations concerning\\nBorrower’s occupancy of the Property as Borrower\\'s principal residence.\\n\\n9. Protection of Lender’s Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument. If (a) Borrower\\nfails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there is a legal proceeding that\\nmight significantly affect Lender’s interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument (such as a\\nproceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien which may attain priority\\nover this Security Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender\\nmay do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights under\\nthis Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property, and securing and/or repairing\\nthe Property. Lender’s actions can include, but are not limited to: (a) paying any sums secured by a lien which has priority\\nover this Security Instrument; (b) appearing in court; and (c) paying reasonable attorneys’ fees to protect its interest in\\nthe Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured position in a bankruptcy proceeding.\\nSecuring the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to make repairs, change locks, replace or\\nboard up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate building or other code violations or dangerous\\nconditions, and have utilities turned on or off. Although Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender does not\\nhave to do so and is not under any duty or obligation to do so. It is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking\\nany or all actions authorized under this Section 9.\\n\\nAny amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this\\nSecurity Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be\\npayable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.\\n\\nIf this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with ail the provisions of the lease. Borrower shall\\nnot surrender the leasehold estate and interests herein conveyed or terminate or cancel the ground lease. Borrower shall\\nnot, without the express written consent of Lender, alter or amend the ground lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the\\nProperty, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.\\n\\n10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage insurance as a condition of making the Loan, Borrower shall\\npay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If, for any reason, the Mortgage Insurance\\ncoverage required by Lender ceases to be available from the mortgage insurer that previously provided such insurance\\nand Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance,\\nBorrower shall pay the premiums required to obtain coverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance\\npreviously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in\\neffect, from an alternate mortgage insurer selected by Lender. If substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage\\nis not available, Borrower shall continue to pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were\\ndue when the insurance coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a non-\\nrefundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be non-refundable, notwithstanding the\\nfact that the Loan is ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on\\nsuch loss reserve. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the amount\\nand for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained,\\nand Lender requires separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required\\nMortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated\\npayments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain\\nMortgage Insurance in effect, or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until Lender\\'s requirement for Mortgage\\nInsurance ends in accordance with any written agreement between Borrower and Lender providing for such termination\\nor until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 10 affects Borrower\\'s obligation to pay interest\\nat the rate provided in the Note.\\n\\nMortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it may incur if\\nBorrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage Insurance.\\n\\nMortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may enter into\\nagreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agreements are on terms and\\nconditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other party (or parties) to these agreements. These\\nagreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer\\nmay have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums).\\n\\nAs a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any reinsurer, any other entity,\\nor any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that derive from (or might be\\ncharacterized as) a portion of Borrower\\'s payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or modifying the\\nmortgage insurer\\'s risk, or reducing losses. If such agreement provides that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the\\ninsurer\\'s risk in exchange for a share of the premiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often termed “captive\\nreinsurance.” Further:\\n\\n(a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for Mortgage\\nInsurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the amount Borrower will owe for\\nMortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund.\\n\\n(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has - if any - with respect to the Mortgage\\nInsurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other law. These rights may include the right to\\nreceive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage Insurance, to have the Mortgage\\n\\nSOUTH CAROLINA--Single Family--Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT Form 3041 1/01 infil: He\\nEllie Mae, Inc.

Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds are hereby assigned to and\\nshail be paid to Lender.\\n\\nIf the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property,\\nif the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender\\'s security is not lessened. During such repair and\\nrestoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity\\nto inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender\\'s satisfaction, provided that such inspection\\nshall be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of\\nprogress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest\\nto be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on\\nsuch Miscellaneous Proceeds. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender’s security would be\\nlessened, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shail be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not\\nthen due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied in the order provided\\nfor in Section 2.\\n\\nIn the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied\\nto the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.\\n\\nIn the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of the Property\\nimmediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or greater than the amount of the sums\\nsecured by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower\\nand Lender otherwise agree in writing, the sums secured by this Security Instrument shall be reduced by the amount\\nof the Miscellaneous Proceeds multiplied by the following fraction: (a) the total amount of the sums secured immediately\\nbefore the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value divided by (b) the fair market value of the Property immediately\\nbefore the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value. Any balance shall be paid to Borrower.\\n\\nin the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of the Property\\nimmediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the amount of the sums secured\\nimmediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in\\nwriting, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument whether or not\\nthe sums are then due.\\n\\nIf the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the Opposing Party (as defined\\nin the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages, Borrower fails to respond to Lender within\\n30 days after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized to collect and apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds either\\nto restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.\\n“Opposing Party” means the third party that owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom\\nBorrower has a right of action in regard to Miscellaneous Proceeds.\\n\\nBorrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in Lender’s judgment,\\ncould result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender\\'s interest in the Property or rights under\\nthis Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if acceleration has occurred, reinstate as provided in\\nSection 19, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a ruling that, in Lender’s judgment, precludes\\nforfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender\\'s interest in the Property or rights under this Security\\nInstrument. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the impairment of Lender\\'s interest\\nin the Property are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender.\\n\\nAll Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be applied in the order\\nprovided for in Section 2.\\n\\n12. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time for payment or\\nmodification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to Borrower or any\\nSuccessor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower or any Successors in Interest of\\nBorrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any Successor in Interest of Borrower or to\\nrefuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by\\nreason of any demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance by\\nLender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation, Lender\\'s acceptance of payments from third\\npersons, entities or Successors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver\\nof or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.\\n\\n13. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants and agrees\\nthat Borrower\\'s obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who co-signs this Security\\nInstrument but does not execute the Note (a “co-signer”): (a) is co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage,\\ngrant and convey the co-signer’s interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally\\nobligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can\\nagree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or\\nthe Note without the co-signer’s consent.\\n\\nSubject to the provisions of Section 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrower\\'s obligations\\nunder this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall obtain all of Borrower\\'s rights and benefits\\nunder this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from Borrower’s obligations and liability under this\\nSecurity Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing. The covenants and agreements of this Security\\nInstrument shall bind (except as provided in Section 20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender.\\n\\n14, Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with Borrower\\'s default,\\nfor the purpose of protecting Lender’s interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including, but\\nnot limited to, attorneys’ fees, property inspection and valuation fees. In regard to any other fees, the absence of express\\nauthority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific fee to Borrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the\\ncharging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by\\nApplicable Law.\\n\\n \\n  \\n\\nSOUTH CAROLINA--Single Family--Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT Form 3041 1/01 Initials:\\nEllie Mae, Inc.

Lender may\\nchoose to make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower.\\nIf a refund reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment charge\\n(whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). Borrower\\'s acceptance of any such refund made\\nby direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such\\novercharge.\\n\\n15. Notices. Ail notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be in writing.\\nAny notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to Borrower when\\nmailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower\\'s notice address if sent by other means. Notice to any\\none Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice\\naddress shall be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender.\\nBorrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower\\'s change of address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting\\nBorrower’s change of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that specified procedure.\\nThere may be only one designated notice address under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any notice to Lender\\nshall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender\\'s address stated herein unless Lender has\\ndesignated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument shall not be\\ndeemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender. If any notice required by this Security Instrument\\nis also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under\\nthis Security Instrument.\\n\\n16. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall be governed by federal\\nlaw and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All rights and obligations contained in this Security\\nInstrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly\\nallow the parties to agree by contract or it might be silent, but such silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against\\nagreement by contract. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with\\nApplicable Law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given\\neffect without the conflicting provision.\\n\\nAs used in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include corresponding neuter\\nwords or words of the feminine gender; (b) words in the singular shall mean and include the plural and vice versa; and\\n(c) the word “may” gives sole discretion without any obligation to take any action.\\n\\n17. Borrower\\'s Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.\\n\\n18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18, “Interest in the -\\nProperty” means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to, those beneficial interests\\ntransferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract or escrow agreement, the intent of which\\nis the transfer of title by Borrower at a future date to a purchaser,\\n\\nIf all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural\\nperson and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender’s prior written consent, Lender may\\nrequire immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be\\nexercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law. -\\n\\nIf Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period\\nof not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower\\nmust pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of\\nthis period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand\\non Borrower.\\n\\n19. Borrower’s Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions, Borrower shall have\\nthe right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time prior to the earliest of: (a) five days\\nbefore sale of the Property pursuant to Section 22 of this Security Instrument; (b) such other period as Applicable Law\\nmight specify for the termination of Borrower\\'s right to reinstate; or (c) entry of a judgment enforcing this Security\\nInstrument. Those conditions are that Borrower: (a) pays Lender all sums which then would be due under this Security\\nInstrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements;\\n(c) pays all expenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’\\nfees, property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender’s interest in\\nthe Property and rights under this Security Instrument; and (d) takes such action as Lender may reasonably require to\\nassure that Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, and Borrower’s obligation to pay\\nthe sums secured by this Security Instrument, shail continue unchanged. Lender may require that Borrower pay such\\nreinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money\\norder, (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer’s check or cashier’s check, provided any such check is drawn upon\\nan institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer.\\nUpon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and obligations secured hereby shall remain fully effective\\nas if no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not apply in the case of acceleration under\\nSection 18.\\n\\n20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial interest in the Note\\n(together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might\\nresult in a change in the entity (known as the “Loan Servicer’) that collects Periodic Payments due under the Note and\\nthis Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the Note, this Security\\nInstrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale of\\nthe Note. If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will state\\nthe name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments should be made and any other\\ninformation RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer of servicing.

Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 21: (a) “Hazardous Substances’ are those substances defined\\nas toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law and the following substances: gasoline,\\nkerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials\\ncontaining asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials; (b) “Environmental Law” means federal laws and laws\\nof the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety or environmental protection; (c)\\n“Environmental Cleanup” includes any response action, remedial action, or removal action, as defined in\\nEnvironmental Law; and (d) an “Environmental Condition” means a condition that can cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger an\\nEnvironmental Cleanup.\\n\\nBorrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous Substances,\\nor threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else\\nto do, anything affecting the Property (a) that is in violation of any Environmental Law, (b) which creates an Environmental\\nCondition, or (c) which, due to the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous Substance, creates a condition that\\nadversely affects the value of the Property. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage\\non the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal\\nresidential uses and to maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer\\nproducts).\\n\\nBorrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or other action\\nby any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance or\\nEnvironmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any Environmental Condition, including but not limited\\nto, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) any condition\\ncaused by the presence, use or release of a Hazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the Property.\\nIf Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or\\nother remediation of any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all\\nnecessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on Lender\\nfor an Environmental Cleanup.\\n\\nNON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:\\n\\n22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower\\'s\\nbreach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to acceleration under Section\\n18 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise). The notice shall specify: (a) the default; (b) the action required\\nto cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given to Borrower, by which the\\ndefault must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in the notice may\\nresult in acceleration of the sums secured by this Security Instrument, foreclosure by judicial proceeding and\\nsale of the Property.

All replacements and additions shall also be covered by this Security\\nInstrument. All of the foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument as the \"Property.\" Borrower\\nunderstands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the interests granted by Borrower in this Security\\nInstrument, but, if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender\\'s\\nsuccessors and assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to, the\\nright to foreclose and sell the Property; and to take any action required of Lender including, but not limited to,\\nreleasing and canceling this Security Instrument.\\n\\nBORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seised of the estate hereby conveyed and has the\\nright to grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for encumbrances of\\nrecord. Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all claims and demands,\\nsubject to any encumbrances of record,\\n\\nTHIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform\\ncovenants with limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real\\nproperty.\\n\\nUNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:\\n\\n1. Payment of Principal, Interest, Escrow Items, Prepayment Charges, and Late Charges. Borrower\\nshall pay when due the principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and any prepayment\\ncharges and late charges due under the Note. Borrower shall also pay funds for Escrow Items pursuant to\\nSection 3. Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be made in U.S. currency.\\nHowever, if any check or other instrument received by Lender as payment under the Note or this Security\\nInstrument is returned to Lender unpaid, Lender may require that any or all subsequent payments due under\\nthe Note and this Security Instrument be made in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender:\\n(a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer\\'s check or cashier\\'s check, provided any\\nsuch check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or\\nentity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer.\\n\\nPayments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at such\\nother location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 15. Lender\\nmay retum any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are insufficient to bring the\\nLoan current. Lender may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan current,\\nwithout waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or partial payments in\\nthe future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such payments at the time such payments are accepted. If each\\nPeriodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay interest on unapplied\\nfunds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment to bring the Loan current. If\\nBorrower does not do so within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either apply such funds or retum\\nthem to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be applied to the outstanding principal balance under\\nthe Note immediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or claim which Borrower might have now or in the future\\nagainst Lender shall relieve Borrower from making payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument\\nor performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.\\n\\n2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, all payments\\naccepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority: (a) interest due under the\\nNote; (b) principal due under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3. Such payments shall be applied to\\neach Periodic Payment in the order in which it became due. Any remaining amounts shall be applied first to\\nlate charges, second to any other amounts due under this Security Instrument, and then to reduce the principal\\nbalance of the Note.\\n\\nIf Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a\\nsufficient amount to pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and the\\nlate charge. If more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received from\\nBorrower to the repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each payment can be paid in\\nfull. To the extent that any excess exists after the payment is applied to the full payment of one or more\\nPeriodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any late charges due. Voluntary prepayments shall be\\napplied first to any prepayment charges and then as described in the Note.\\n\\nAny application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under the\\nNote shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments.\\n\\n3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due under\\nthe Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the \"Funds\") to provide for payment of amounts due for: (a)\\ntaxes and assessments and other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a lien or\\nencumbrance on the Property; (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; (c) premiums\\nfor any and all insurance required by Lender under Section 5; and (d) Mortgage Insurance premiums, if any, or\\nany sums payable by Borrower to Lender in lieu of the payment of Mortgage Insurance premiums in\\naccordance with the provisions of Section 10. These items are called \"Escrow Items.\" At origination or at any\\ntime during the term of the Loan, Lender may require that Community Association Dues, Fees, and\\nAssessments, if any, be escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an Escrow Item.\\n\\n& -6A(SC) (0409) CHL (08/05) Page 3 of 11 Form 3041 1/01\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nK 0 586PG468\\n\\n. \\' re\\nDOC ID #: 00013-744656505006°\\n\\nBorrower shall promptly furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower shail\\npay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives Borrower\\'s obligation to pay the Funds for any\\nor all Escrow Items. Lender may waive Borrower\\'s obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow\\nItems at any time. Any such waiver may only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay\\ndirectly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds has\\nbeen waived by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment\\nwithin such time period as Lender may require. Borrower\\'s obligation to make such payments and to provide\\nreceipts shall for all purposes be deemed to be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security\\nInstrument, as the phrase \"covenant and agreement\" is used in Section 9. If Borrower is obligated to pay\\nEscrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item,\\nLender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated\\nunder Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow\\nItems at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section 15 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall\\npay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.\\n\\nLender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to apply the\\nFunds at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can require\\nunder RESPA. Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and reasonable\\nestimates of expenditures of future Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable Law.\\n\\nThe Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality,\\nor entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in any Federal Home\\nLoan Bank. Lender shall apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time specified under\\nRESPA. Lender shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying the Funds, annually analyzing the escrow\\naccount, or verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable\\nLaw permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless an agreement is tnade in writing or Applicable Law\\nrequires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings\\non the Funds. Borrower and Lender can agree in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the Funds.\\nLender shall give to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds as required by RESPA.\\n\\nIf there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account to Borrower\\nfor the excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in escrow, as defined\\nunder RESPA, Lender shall notify Borrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the\\namount necessary to make up the shortage in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than !2 monthly\\npayments. If there is a deficiency of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall notify\\nBorrower as required by RESPA, and Borrower shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the\\ndeficiency in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than 12 monthly payments.\\n\\nUpon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly refund to\\nBorrower any Funds held by Lender.\\n\\n4. Charges; Liens. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions attributable\\nto the Property which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, leasehold payments or ground rents on\\nthe Property, if any, and Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any. To the extent that these\\nitems are Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them in the manner provided in Section 3.\\n\\nBorrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless\\nBorrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to\\nLender, but only so long as Borrower is performing such agreement; (b) contests the lien in good faith by, or\\ndefends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender\\'s opinion operate to prevent the\\nenforcement of the lien while those proceedings are pending, but only until such proceedings are concluded;\\nor (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this\\nSecurity Instrument. If Lender determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which can attain\\npriority over this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Within 10 days\\nof the date on which that notice is given, Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions set\\nforth above in this Section 4.\\n\\nLender may require Borrower to pay a one-time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or reporting\\nservice used by Lender in connection with this Loan.\\n\\n§. Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on the\\nProperty insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term “extended coverage,\" and any other\\nhazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance. This\\ninsurance shall be maintained in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender\\nrequires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can change during the term of the Loan.\\nThe insurance carrier providing the insurance shall be chosen by Borrower subject to Lender\\'s right to\\ndisapprove Borrower\\'s choice, which right shall not be exercised unreasonably. Lender may require Borrower\\nto pay, in connection with this Loan, either: (a) a one-time charge for flood zone determination, certification\\nand tracking services; or (b) a one-time charge for flood zone determination and certification services and\\nsubsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which reasonably might affect such\\ndetermination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the\\nFederal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone determination\\nresulting from an objection by Borrower.\\n\\n& -6A(SC) (0409) CHL (08/05) Page 4 of 11 Form 3041 1/01\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nE\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nKO 586PG4K69\\n\\nDOC ID #: 00013744656505006.\\n\\nIf Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may. obtain insurance -\\ncoverage, at Lender\\'s option and Borrower\\'s expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular\\ntype or amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might not protect ”\\nBorrower, Borrower\\'s equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard or\\nliability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect. Borrower acknowledges\\nthat the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained might significantly exceed the cost of insurance that\\nBorrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 5 shall become additional\\ndebt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from\\nthe date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower\\nrequesting payment.\\n\\nAll insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender\\'s right\\nto disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name Lender as mortgagee\\nand/or as an additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and renewal certificates. If\\nLender requires, Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. If\\nBorrower obtains any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or\\ndestruction of. the Property, such policy shall include a standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as\\nmortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.\\n\\nIn the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender may\\nmake proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree in\\nwriting, any insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall be\\napplied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and\\nLender\\'s security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold\\nsuch insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has\\nbeen completed to Lender\\'s satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender\\nmay disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments\\nas the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be\\npaid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on\\nsuch proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower shall not be paid out of\\nthe insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower. If the restoration or repair is not\\neconomically feasible or Lender\\'s security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied to the\\nsums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.\\nSuch insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.\\n\\nIf Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance claim\\nand related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the insurance\\ncarrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day period will\\nbegin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section 22 or\\notherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower\\'s rights to any insurance proceeds in an amount\\nnot to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, and (b) any other of Borrower\\'s\\nrights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by Borrower) under all insurance policies\\ncovering the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to the coverage of the Property. Lender may use\\nthe insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property or to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this\\nSecurity Instrument, whether or not then due.\\n\\n6. Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower\\'s principal residence\\nwithin 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as\\nBorrower\\'s principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise\\nagrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or untess extenuating circumstances exist\\nwhich are beyond Borrower\\'s control.\\n\\n7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower shall not\\ndestroy, damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the Property.\\nWhether or not Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain the Property in order to prevent\\nthe Property from deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless it is determined pursuant to\\nSection 5 that repair or restoration is not economically feasible, Borrower shall promptly repair the Property if\\ndamaged to avoid further deterioration or damage. If insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid in\\nconnection with damage to, or the taking of, the Property, Borrower shall be responsible for repairing or\\nrestoring the Property only if Lender has released proceeds for such purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds\\nfor the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is\\ncompleted. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or restore the Property,\\nBorrower is not relieved of Borrower\\'s obligation for the completion of such repair or restoration.\\n\\nLender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If it has\\nreasonable cause, Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender shall give\\nBorrower notice at the time of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.\\n\\n8. Borrower\\'s Loan Application. Borrower shail be in default if, during the Loan application process,\\nBorrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower\\'s knowledge or\\nconsent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to\\nprovide Lender with material information) in connection with the Loan. Material representations include, but\\nare not limited to, representations concerning Borrower\\'s occupancy of the Property as Borrower\\'s principal\\nresidence.\\n\\n& -6A(SC) (0408) CHL (08/05) Page 5 of 11 Form 3041 1/01\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nE\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nK O 586PG470\\n\\nDOC ID #: 00013744656505006\\n\\n9. Protection of Lender\\'s Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument. If (a)_\\nBorrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there is a\\nlegal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender\\'s interest in the Property and/or rights under this -\\nSecurity Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for\\nenforcement of a lien which may attain priority over this Security Instrument or to enforce laws or\\nregulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is\\nreasonable or appropriate to protect Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument,\\nincluding protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property, and securing and/or repairing the Property.\\nLender\\'s actions can include, but are not limited to: (a) paying any sums secured by a lien which has priority\\nover this Security Instrument; (b) appearing in court; and (c) paying reasonable attorneys’ fees to protect its\\ninterest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument. including its secured position in a\\nbankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to make\\nrepairs, change locks, replace or board up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate building or\\nother code violations or dangerous conditions. and have utilities tumed on or off. Although Lender may take\\naction under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so and is not under any duty or obligation to do so. It\\nis agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking any or all actions authorized under this Section 9.\\n\\nAny amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured\\nby this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement\\nand shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.\\n\\nIf this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of the lease.\\nIf Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge unless Lender\\nagrees to the merger in writing.\\n\\n10. Mortgage Insurance. 1f Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan,\\nBorrower shall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If, for any reason, the\\nMortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available from the mortgage insurer that\\npreviously provided such insurance and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments\\ntoward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to obtain coverage\\nsubstantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the\\ncost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer selected\\nby Lender. If substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower shall continue\\nto pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the insurance coverage\\nceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a non-refundable loss reserve in\\nheu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be non-refundable, notwithstanding the fact that the Loan\\nis ultimately paid in full, and Lender shal! not be required to pay Borrower any interest or eamings on such\\nloss reserve. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the\\namount and for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes\\navailable, is obtained, and Lender requires separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage\\nInsurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was\\nrequired to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower\\nshall pay the premiums required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in effeet, or to provide a non-refundable loss\\nreserve, until Lender\\'s requirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance with any written agreement\\nbetween Borrower and Lender providing for such termination or until termination is required by Applicable\\nLaw. Nothing in this Section 10 affects Borrower\\'s obligation to pay interest at the rate provided in the Note.\\n\\nMortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it may\\nincur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage Insurance.\\n\\nMortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may enter\\ninto agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agreements are on\\nterms and conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other party (or parties) to these\\nagreements. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of funds\\nthat the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance\\npremiums).\\n\\nAs a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any reinsurer, any\\nother entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that derive\\nfrom (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower\\'s payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for\\nsharing or modifying the mortgage insurer\\'s risk, or reducing losses. If such agreement provides that an\\naffiliate of Lender takes a share of the insurer\\'s risk in exchange for a share of the premiums paid to the\\ninsurer, the arrangement is often termed “captive reinsurance.” Further:\\n\\n(a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for Mortgage\\nInsurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the amount Borrower will\\nowe for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund.\\n\\n(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has - if any - with respect to the\\nMortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other law. These rights may\\ninclude the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage\\nInsurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance terminated automatically, and/or to receive a refund of any\\nMortgage Insurance premiums that were unearned at the time of such cancellation or termination.\\n\\n& -6A(SC) (0409) CHL (08/05) Page 6 of 11 Form 3041 1/01\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nE\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nBO S86PGN7\\n\\nDOC ID #: 00013744656505006.\\n\\n11, Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Miscellaneous Proceeds ° are hereby\\nassigned to and shall be paid to Lender. ° :\\n\\nIf the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of the\\nProperty, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender\\'s security is not lessened. During such\\nrepair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has\\nhad an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender\\'s satisfaction,\\nprovided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in\\na single disbursement or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is\\nmade in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender shall\\nnot be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous Proceeds. If the restoration or\\nrepair is not economically feasible or Lender\\'s security would be lessened, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall\\nbe applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any.\\npaid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.\\n\\nIn the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, the Miscellaneous Proceeds\\nshall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if\\nany, paid to Borrower.\\n\\nIn the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value\\nof the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or greater than\\nthe amount of the sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial taking, destruction,\\nor loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the sums secured by this Security\\nInstrument shall be reduced by the amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds multiplied by the following fraction:\\n(a) the total amount of the sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value\\ndivided by (b) the fair market value of the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss\\nin value. Any balance shall be paid to Borrower.\\n\\nIn the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value\\nof the Property immediately before the partial taking. destruction, or loss in value is less than the amount of\\nthe sums secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and\\nLender otherwise agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this\\nSecurity Instrument whether or not the sums are then due.\\n\\nIf the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the Opposing\\nParty (as defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages, Borrower fails to\\nrespond to Lender within 30 days after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized to collect and apply\\nthe Miscellaneous Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums secured by this\\nSecurity Instrument, whether or not then due. \"Opposing Party\" means the third party that owes Borrower\\nMiscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom Borrower has a right of action in regard to Miscellaneous\\nProceeds.\\n\\nBorrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in\\nLender\\'s judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender\\'s interest\\nin the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if acceleration\\nhas occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 19, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a\\nruling that, in Lender\\'s judgment, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender\\'s\\ninterest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. The proceeds of any award or claim for\\ndamages that are attributable to the impairment of Lender\\'s interest in the Property are hereby assigned and\\nshall be paid to Lender.\\n\\nAll Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be applied in\\nthe order provided for in Section 2.\\n\\n12. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time for\\npayment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to\\nBorrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower or any\\nSuccessors in Interest of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any\\nSuccessor in Interest of Borrower or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of\\nthe sums secured by this Security Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or any\\nSuccessors in Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including,\\nwithout limitation, Lender\\'s acceptance of payments from third persons, entities or Successors in Interest of\\nBorrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any\\nright or remedy.\\n\\n13. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants and\\nagrees that Borrower\\'s obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who\\nco-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note (a \"co-signer\"): (a) is co-signing this Security\\nInstrument only to mortgage, grant and convey the co-signer\\'s interest in the Property under the terms of this\\nSecurity Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and\\n(c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any\\naccommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without the co-signer\\'s\\nconsent.\\n\\neS -6A(SC) (0409) CHL (08/05) Page 7 of 11 Form 3041 1/01\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nE\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nKO S86PGK72\\n\\nDOC ID #: 00013744656505006\\n\\nSubject to the provisions of Section 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrower\\'s\\nobligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shail obtain all of Borrower\\'s\\nrights and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from Borrower\\'s obligations\\nand liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing. The covenants and\\nagreements of this Security Instrument shall bind (except as provided in Section 20) and benefit the successors\\nand assigns of Lender.\\n\\n14, Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with\\nBorrower\\'s default, for the purpose of protecting Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights under this\\nSecurity Instrument, including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees, property inspection and valuation fees. In\\nregard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific fee to\\nBorrower shall not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that\\nare expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.\\n\\nIf the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so\\nthat the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the\\npermitted limits. then: (a} any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge\\nto the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will\\nbe refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the\\nNote or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as\\na partial prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for\\nunder the Note). Borrower\\'s acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will\\nconstitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.\\n\\n15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must\\nbe in writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have\\nbeen given to Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower\\'s notice\\naddress if sent by other means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless\\nApplicable Law expressly requires otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address unless\\nBorrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall promptly notify\\nLender of Borrower\\'s change of address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower\\'s change of\\naddress, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that specified procedure. There may be\\nonly one designated notice address under this Security Instrument at any one time. Any notice to Lender shall\\nbe given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender\\'s address stated herein unless Lender has\\ndesignated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument\\nshall not be deemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender. If any notice required by\\nthis Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy\\nthe corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.\\n\\n16, Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall be governed\\nby federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All rights and obligations\\ncontained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law.\\nApplicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it might be silent, but\\nsuch silence shall not be construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. In the event that any\\nprovision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shall\\nnot affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the\\nconflicting provision.\\n\\nAs used in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include\\ncorresponding neuter words or words of the feminine gender; (b) words in the singular shall mean and include\\nthe plural and vice versa; and (c) the word \"may\" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take any\\naction.\\n\\n17. Borrower\\'s Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.\\n\\n18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18,\\n“Interest in the Property” means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to,\\nthose beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, instaliment sales contract or escrow\\nagreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a future date to a purchaser.\\n\\nIfall or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not\\na natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender\\'s prior written\\nconsent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument.\\nHowever, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.\\n\\nIf Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall\\nprovide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15\\nwithin which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these\\nsums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security\\nInstrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.\\n\\n19. Borrower\\'s Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions, Borrower\\nshall have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time prior to the\\nearliest of: (a) five days before sale of the Property pursuant to Section 22 of this Security Instrument; (b) such\\nother period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Borrower\\'s right to reinstate; or (c) entry\\nof a judgment enforcing this Security Instrument. Those conditions are that Borrower: (a) pays Lender all\\n\\nDD -saiscy oss, CHL (08/05) Page 8 of 11 Form 3041 1/01\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nEz\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nK 0 586P6473\\n\\nboc ID #: 00013744656505006 :\\nsums which then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; °\\n(b) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements; (c) pays all expenses incurred in enforcing this\\nSecurity Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, property inspection and valuation\\nfees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights under\\nthis Security Instrument; and (d) takes such action as Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender\\'s\\ninterest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, and Borrower\\'s obligation to pay the sums\\nsecured by this Security Instrument, shall continue unchanged. Lender may require that Borrower pay such\\nreinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b)\\nmoney order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer\\'s check or cashier\\'s check, provided any such check is\\ndrawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or entity: or (d)\\nElectronic Funds Transfer. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and obligations secured\\nhereby shall remain fully effective as if no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not\\napply in the case of acceleration under Section 18.\\n\\n20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial interest in the\\nNote (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower.\\nA sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the \"Loan Servicer\") that collects Periodic Payments\\ndue under the Note and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under\\nthe Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes of the Loan\\nServicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given\\nwritten notice of the change which will state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to\\nwhich payments should be made and any other information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of\\ntransfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the\\npurchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations to Borrower will remain with the Loan Servicer\\nor be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not assumed by the Note purchaser unless otherwise\\nprovided by the Note purchaser.\\n\\nNeither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an\\nindividual litigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party\\'s actions pursuant to this Security\\nInstrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of,\\nthis Security Instrument. until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such notice given in\\ncompliance with the requirements of Section 15) of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a\\nreasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. If Applicable Law provides a time\\nperiod which must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable\\nfor purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant\\nto Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall be deemed to\\nsatisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 20.\\n\\n21. Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 21: (a) “Hazardous Substances\" are those substances\\ndefined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law and the following\\nsubstances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides,\\nvolatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials; (b)\\n\"Environmental Law\" means federal laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate\\nto health, safety or environmental protection; (c) “Environmental Cleanup\" includes any response action,\\nremedial action, or removal action, as defined in Environmental Law; and (d) an “Environmental Condition\"\\nmeans a condition that can cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger an Environmental Cleanup.\\n\\nBorrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous\\nSubstances, or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor\\nallow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property (a) that is in violation of any Environmental Law, (b)\\nwhich creates an Environmental Condition, or (c) which, due to the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous\\nSubstance, creates a condition that adversely affects the value of the Property. The preceding two sentences\\nshall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances\\nthat are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property\\n(including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products).\\n\\nBorrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or\\nother action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any\\nHazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any Environmental\\nCondition, including but not limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of release of any\\nHazardous Substance, and (c) any condition caused by the presence, use or release of a Hazardous Substance\\nwhich adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or\\nregulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substance\\naffecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance\\nwith Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on Lender for an Environmental Cleanup.\\n\\n  \\n\\nNON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:\\n\\n22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following\\nBorrower\\'s breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to\\nacceleration under Section 18 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise). The notice shall specify: (a)\\nthe default; (b) the action required to cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the date the\\n\\n& -6A(SC) (0409) CHL (08/05) Page 9 of 11 Form 3041 1/01\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nE\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nKO S86PGK74\\n\\nDoc ID #: 00013744656505006\\nnotice is given to Borrower, by which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default .\\non or before the date specified in the notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured by ‘this\\nSecurity Instrument, foreclosure by judicial proceeding and sale of the Property. The notice shall |\\nfurther inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to assert in the\\nforeclosure proceeding the non-existence of a default or any other defense of Borrower to acceleration\\nand foreclosure. If the default is not cured on or before the date specified in the notice, Lender at its\\noption may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without\\nfurther demand and may foreclose this Security Instrument by judicial proceeding. Lender shall be\\nentitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Section 22, including,\\nbut not limited to, reasonable attorneys\\' fees and costs of title evidence, all of which shall be additional\\nsums secured by this Security Instrument.\\n\\n23. Release. Upon Payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, this Security Instrument\\nshall become null and void. Lender shall release this Security Instrument. Borrower shall pay any recordation\\ncosts. Lender may charge Borrower a fee for releasing this Security Instrument, but only if the fee is paid to a\\nthird party for services rendered and the charging of the fee is permitted under Applicable Law.\\n\\n24. Homestead Waiver. Borrower waives all rights of homestead exemption in the Property to the\\nextent allowed by Applicable Law.\\n\\n25, Waiver of Appraisal Rights. The laws of South Carolina provide that in any real estate foreclosure\\nproceeding a defendant against whom a personal judgment is taken or asked may within 30 days after the sale\\nof the mortgaged property apply to the court for an order of appraisal. The statutory appraisal value as\\napproved by the court would be substituted for the high bid and may decrease the amount of any deficiency\\nowing in connection with the transaction. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE UNDERSIGNED\\nHEREBY WAIVES AND RELINQUISHES THE STATUTORY APPRAISAL RIGHTS WHICH MEANS\\nTHE HIGH BID AT THE JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE SALE WILL BE APPLIED TO THE DEBT\\nREGARDLESS OF ANY APPRAISED VALUE OF THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY. This waiver shall not\\napply so long as the Property is used as a dwelling place as defined in Section 12-37-250 of the South\\nCarolina Code of Laws.\\n\\n26, Future Advances. The lien of this Security Instrument shall secure the existing indebtedness under\\nthe Note and any future advances made under this Security Instrument up to 150% of the original principal\\namount of the Note plus interest thereon, attorneys’ fees and court costs.\\n\\nBY SIGNING BELOW, Borrower accepts and agrees to the terms and covenants contained in this\\nSecurity Instrument and in any Rider executed by Borrower and recorded with it.\\n\\navin in.

In addition to the covenants and agreements made in the Security\\nInstrument, Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:\\n\\nA, ADJUSTABLE RATE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT CHANGES\\nThe Note provides for an initial fixed interest rate of 7.000 %. The Note also provides\\nfor change in the initial fixed rate to an adjustable interest rate, as follows:\\n\\n4. ADJUSTABLE INTEREST RATE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT CHANGES\\n\\n(A) Change Dates\\n\\nThe initia! fixed interest rate I will pay will change to an adjustable interest rate on the\\nfirst day of JUNE, 2011 , and the adjustable interest rate I will\\npay may change on that day every 12th month thereafter. The date on which my initial fixed interest rate\\nchanges to an adjustable interest rate, and each date on which my adjustable interest rate could change, is\\ncalled a “Change Date.”\\n\\n(B) The Index\\n\\nBeginning with the first Change Date, my adjustable interest rate will be based on an Index. The \"Index\"\\nis the average of interbank offered rates for twelve month U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London\\nmarket, as published in the The Wall Street Journal. The most recent Index figure available as of the first\\nbusiness day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the Change Date occurs is called the\\n\"Current Index.\"\\n\\nIf the Index is no longer available, the Note Holder will choose a new index that is based upon\\ncomparable information. The Note Holder will give me notice of this choice.\\n\\n(C) Calculation of Changes\\n\\nBefore each Change Date, the Note Holder will calculate my new interest rate by adding\\nTWO & ONE-QUARTER percentage points ( 2.250 %)to the Current Index.\\nThe Note Holder will then round the result of this addition to the nearest one-eighth of one percentage point\\n(0.125%). Subject to the limits stated in Section 4(D) below, this rounded amount will be my new interest rate\\n\\nuntil the next Change Date.\\nThe Note Holder will then determine the amount of the monthly payment that would be sufficient to\\n\\nrepay the unpaid principal that I am expected to owe at the Change Date in full on the Maturity Date at my\\nnew interest rate in substantially equal payments. The result of this calculation will be the new amount of my\\nmonthly payment.\\n\\n(D) Limits on Interest Rate Changes\\n\\nThe interest rate I am required to pay at the first Change Date will not be greater than\\n\\n12.000 %or less than 2.250 %. Thereafter, my adjustable interest rate will never\\nbe increased or decreased on any single Change Date by more than two percentage points from the rate of\\ninterest I have been paying for the preceding 12 months. My’ interest rate will never be greater than\\n\\n12.000 3.\\n\\n(E) Effective Date of Changes\\n\\nMy new interest rate will become effective on each Change Date. | will pay the amount of my new\\nmonthly payment beginning on the first monthly payment date after the Change Date until the amount of my\\nmonthly payment changes again.\\n\\n(F) Notice of Changes\\n\\nThe Note Holder will deliver or mail to me a notice of any changes in my initial fixed interest rate to an\\nadjustable interest rate and of any changes in my adjustable interest rate before the effective date of any\\nchange. The notice will include the amount of my monthly payment, any information required by law to be\\ngiven to me and also the title and telephone number of a person who will answer any question } may have\\nregarding the notice.\\n\\nCONV\\n\\n@ ARM Fixed Period LIBOR Rider\\n2U652-XX (04/01) Page 2 of 4 Initials: ken 4\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nE\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nMO S86PbK85,\\n\\nDoc ID #: 00013744656505006\\nB. TRANSFER OF THE PROPERTY OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN BORROWER\\n1. Until Borrower\\'s initial fixed interest rate changes to an adjustable interest rate under the terms stated\\nin Section A above, Uniform Covenant 18 of the Security Instrument shall read as follows:\\n\\nTransfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18,\\n\"Interest in the Property” means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not\\nlimited to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment\\nsales contract or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a\\nfuture date to a purchaser.\\n\\nIf all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if\\nBorrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without\\nLender\\'s prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured\\nby this Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise\\nis prohibited by Applicable Law.\\n\\nIf Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice\\nshall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with\\nSection 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If\\nBorrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any\\nremedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.\\n\\n2. When Borrower\\'s initial fixed interest rate changes to an adjustable interest rate under the\\nterms stated in Section A above, Uniform Covenant 18 of the Security Instrument described in\\nSection B1! above shall then cease to be in effect, and the provisions of Uniform Covenant 18 of the\\nSecurity Instrument shall be amended to read as follows:\\n\\nTransfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18,\\n\"Interest in the Property” means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not\\nlimited to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment\\nsales contract or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a\\nfuture date to a purchaser.\\n\\nIf all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if\\nBorrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without\\nLender\\'s prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured\\nby this Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise\\nis prohibited by Applicable Law. Lender also shall not exercise this option if: (a) Borrower causes\\nto be submitted to Lender information required by Lender to evaluate the intended transferee as if a\\nnew loan were being made to the transferee; and (b) Lender reasonably determines that Lender\\'s\\nsecurity will not be impaired by the loan assumption and that the risk of a breach of any covenant or\\nagreement in this Security Instrument is acceptable to Lender.\\n\\nTo the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Lender may charge a reasonable fee as a\\ncondition to Lender\\'s consent to the loan assumption, Lender also may require the transferee to sign\\nan assumption agreement that is acceptable to Lender and that obligates the transferee to keep all\\nthe promises and agreements made in the Note and in this Security Instrument. Borrower will\\ncontinue to be obligated under the Note and this Security Instrument unless Lender releases\\nBorrower in writing.\\n\\nIf Lender exercises the option to require immediate payment in full, Lender shall give\\nBorrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the\\ndate the notice is given in accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums\\nsecured by this Security Instrument.

Units owned by the Declarant shall not be subject to Annual Assessments or\\nSpecial Assessments so long as such Units are owned by the Declarant. So long as the Declarant\\nhas the right to appoint and remove any member or members of the Board of Directors of the\\nAssociation under the provisions of Article 21 below, Declarant shall have the option, but shall\\nnot be required to, loan funds to the Association to make up any deficits in the budget and shall\\nhave the option of charging interest on all funds advanced to the Association used to fund such\\ndeficits.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the membership disapproves the\\nproposed budget or the Board fails for any reason so to determine the budget for the succeeding\\nyear, then and until such time as a budget shall have been determined as provided herein, the\\nbudget in effect for the current year shall continue for the succeeding year. In such case, the\\nBoard may propose a new budget at any time during the year at a special meeting of the\\nAssociation. The proposed budget and Annual Assessment shall be delivered to the members at\\nleast thirty (30) days prior to the proposed effective date thereof and at least seven (7) days prior\\nto the special meeting. The approval procedure set forth above for budgets considered at annual\\nmeetings shall! also apply to budgets considered at special meetings.\\n\\n{00693700.6} 14\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\naK J 576PG696\\n\\n10.5 Special Assessments.

Nothing contained herein\\ngives any Owner or other party a priority over the rights of first Mortgagees as to distribution of\\ninsurance proceeds.\\n\\n(h) Every Unit Owner shall be obligated to obtain and maintain at all times insurance\\ncovering those portions of his or her Unit to the extent not insured by policies maintained by the\\nAssociation. Upon request by the Board, the Unit Owner shall furnish a copy of such insurance\\npolicy or policies to the Association. In the event that any such Unit Owner fails to obtain\\ninsurance as required by this subsection, the Association may purchase such insurance on behalf\\nof the Unit Owner and assess the cost thereof to the Unit Owner, to be collected in the manner\\nprovided for collection of assessments under Article 10 hereof.\\n\\n(i) In the event of an insured loss, any required deductible shall be considered a\\n\\nmaintenance expense to be paid by the person or persons who would be responsible for such loss\\nin the absence of insurance.

If any Owner or Owners fail to pay the deductible when\\nrequired under this subsection, then the Association may pay the deductible and assess the cost to\\nthe Owner or Owners pursuant to Article 10 of this Master Deed.\\n\\nARTICLE 12\\nREPAIR AND RECONSTRUCTION\\n\\nIn the event of damage to or destruction of all or any part of the Regime insured by the\\nAssociation as a result of fire or other casualty, the Board of Directors or its duly authorized\\nagent shall arrange for and supervise the prompt repair and restoration of the structure.\\nNotwithstanding the above, the Association may elect not to proceed with reconstruction and\\nrepair if Owners holding eighty percent (80%) of the total votes in the Association, and Eligible\\nMortgagees representing at least fifty-one (51%) of the Units subject to a Mortgage, so decide.\\n\\n12.1 Cost Estimates. Immediately after a fire or other casualty causing damage to the\\nRegime, the Board of Directors shall obtain reliable and detailed estimates of the cost of\\nrepairing and restoring the structures (including any damaged Unit) to substantially the condition\\nwhich existed before such casualty, allowing for any changes or improvements necessitated by\\nchanges in applicable building codes. Such costs may also include professional fees and\\npremiums for such bonds as the Board of Directors determines to be necessary.\\n\\n12.2 Source and Allocation of Proceeds. If the proceeds of insurance are not sufficient\\nto defray the estimated costs of reconstruction and repair, as determined by the Board of\\nDirectors, or if at any time during the reconstruction and repair or upon completion of\\nreconstruction and repair the funds for the payment of the costs thereof are insufficient, the\\nadditional costs shall be assessed against all Owners in proportion to each Owner\\'s respective\\nundivided interest in the Common Elements. This assessment shall not be considered a special\\nassessment. If there is a surplus of funds after repair and reconstruction is completed, such funds\\nshall be common funds of the Association to be used as directed by the Board of Directors.\\n\\n12.3. Plans and Specifications. Any such reconstruction or repair shall be substantially\\nin accordance with the plans and specifications under which the Regime was originally\\nconstructed, except where changes are necessary to comply with current applicable building\\ncodes or where improvements not in accordance with the original plans and specifications are\\napproved by the Board of Directors. To the extent insurance proceeds are available, the\\nAssociation may reconstruct or repair Owner improvements damaged as a result of fire or other\\ncasualty.\\n\\n12.4 Encroachments. Encroachments upon or in favor of Units which may be created\\nas a result of such reconstruction or repair shall not constitute a claim or basis for any proceeding\\nor action by the Unit Owner upon whose property such encroachment exists, provided that such\\nreconstruction was substantially in accordance with the architectural plans under which the\\n\\n{00693700.6} 20\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nke J 576PG702\\n\\nRegime was originally constructed. Such encroachments shall be allowed to continue in\\nexistence for so long as the reconstructed building shall stand.\\n\\n12.5 Construction Fund. The net proceeds of the insurance collected on account of a\\ncasualty and the funds collected by the Association from assessments against Unit Owners on\\naccount of such casualty shall constitute a construction fund which shall be disbursed in payment\\nof the cost of reconstruction and repair in the manner set forth in this Section to be disbursed by\\nthe Association in appropriate progress payments to such contractor(s), supplier(s), and\\npersonnel performing the work or supplying materials or services for the repair and\\nreconstruction of the buildings as are designated by the Board of Directors.\\n\\nARTICLE 13\\nARCHITECTURAL CONTROL\\n\\n13.1 Architectural Standards.

Applications for approval of any such architectural modification shall be in writing\\nand shall provide such information as the ARB may reasonably require. The ARB or its\\ndesignated representative shall ‘be the sole arbiter of such application and may withhold approval\\nfor any reason, including purély aesthetic considerations, and it shall be entitled to stop any\\nconstruction which is not in conformance with approved plans. The Board of Directors or the\\nARB may publish written architectural standards for exterior and Common Elements alterations\\nor additions, and any request in substantial compliance therewith shall be approved; provided,\\nhowever, each such requested change shall be in harmony with the external design of the existing\\nbuildings and Units and the location in relation to surrounding structures and topography. The\\nARB may allow such encroachments on the Common Elements and Limited Common Elements\\nas it deems acceptable.\\n\\nIn the event that the ARB fails to approve or to disapprove such application within forty-\\nfive (45) days after the application and all information as the ARB may reasonably require have\\nbeen submitted, its approval will not be required and this subsection (a) will be deemed complied\\nwith; provided however, even if the requirements of this subsection are satisfied, nothing herein\\nshall authorize anyone to construct or maintain any structure or improvement that is otherwise in\\nviolation of the Master Deed, the By-Laws, or the rules and regulations.\\n\\n13.2 Architectural Review Board.

The ARB shall consist of one (1) to three (3) members, with the exact\\nnumber being set from time to time by and in the sole discretion of the Declarant for so long as\\nthe Declarant retains the right to appoint and remove Board members. There shall be no\\nsurrender of these rights prior to their expiration as provided above, except in a written\\ninstrument in recordable form executed by Declarant; provided, however, that Declarant may\\ndelegate certain authority of the ARB to the Association for such periods of time as Declarant in\\nits sole discretion may decide. Upon expiration or permanent surrender of such rights, the Board\\nshall set the number of members of the ARB and appoint the members of the ARB, who shall\\nthereafter serve and may be removed in the Board’s discretion.\\n\\n13.3 Condition of Approval. As a condition of approval for a requested architectural\\nchange, modification, addition, or alteration, an Owner, on behalf of such Owner and such\\nOwner\\'s successors-in-interest, shall assume all responsibilities for maintenance, repair,\\nreplacement and insurance of such change, modification, addition, or alteration. In the discretion\\nof the ARB, an Owner may be required to verify such condition of approval by written\\ninstrument in recordable form acknowledged by such Owner.\\n\\n13.4 Limitation of Liability.

Each Owner acknowledges that the members of\\nthe Board of Directors and the ARB will change from time to time and that interpretation,\\napplication and enforcement of the architectural standards may vary accordingly. The approval\\nof either the Board of Directors or the ARB of any proposals, plans and specifications or\\ndrawings for any work done or proposed, or in connection with any other matter requiring the\\napproval and consent of the Board of Directors or the ARB, shall not be deemed to constitute a\\nwaiver of any right to withhold approval or consent as to any similar proposals, plans and\\nspecifications, drawings, or matters whatever subsequently or additionally submitted for\\napproval or consent.\\n\\n13.6 Enforcement. Any construction, alteration, or other work done in violation of this\\nArticle shall be deemed to be nonconforming.

Should an Owner fail to remove and restore as required hereunder, the ARB shall\\nhave the right to enter the property, remove the violation and restore the property to substantially\\nthe same condition as existed prior to the construction, alteration or other work. All costs\\nthereof, including reasonable attorney\\'s fees, may be assessed against the Unit and collected as\\n\\n{00693700.6} 22\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nhk J S76PG704\\n\\nan assessment pursuant to this Master Deed.

STORMWATER AND GROUND WATER\\n\\n \\n\\n‘ 4.7.1. Stormwater Runoff\\n\\nUnless otherwise expressly approved in writing by the Board\\nof Directors or the Development Review Board, each Owner\\nshall cause all development activity on its property to be\\nsuch that stormwater runoff from the property is discharged\\ninto a stormwater drainage system that (a) has been approved\\nby any required regulatory authority, and (b) is shown on a\\nrecorded easement, plat, supplemental declaration or similar\\ndocument that has been approved by the Association or the\\nDeclarant.

Calculating Consumer Price Index for Budget. Section\\n6.1.1 of the Declaration includes a provision for automatic\\nadjustment of the annual budget of the Association to reflect an\\nincrease in the Consumer Price Index in the event that a new\\nbudget has not been adopted by the Board of Directors of the\\nAssociation. The adjustment is based on the increase in the\\nConsumer Price Index for the current calendar year as compared to\\nthe preceding calendar year. Because of the timing of the\\nadjustment, it is probable that the Consumer Price Index for the\\ncurrent calendar year will not then be known. To remedy this\\nconflict, Section 6.1.1 is deleted and the following re-stated\\nwording is substituted therefor:\\n\\n \\n\\n“6.1.1. Fiscal Year and Annual Budget\\nThe fiscal year of the Association shall be the\\ncalendar year. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of\\nDirectors, the Board of Directors shall prepare or cause to\\nbe prepared by December 1 an operating budget (the \"Budget\")\\nfor the next fiscal year setting forth the estimated Common\\nExpenses and anticipated revenues of the Association for such\\nfiscal year, and any projected deficit or surplus from the\\nPreceding fiscal year. The Budget, once approved by the\\nBoard of Directors, shall serve as the basis for assessments\\nto all Owners (the \"Total Assessments\") for such fiscal year\\nand the primary guideline under which the Association shall\\nbe projected to be operated during such fiscal year. If the\\nBoard fails for any reason to adopt a Budget for the fiscal\\nyear, then until such time as it is adopted, the Budget and\\nTotal Assessments in effect for the current year shall\\nautomatically be increased effective the first day of the\\nfiscal year in the same Proportion as any percentage increase\\nduring the current Year over the preceding Year, in the\\nConsumer Price Index, all Urban Consumers, United States City\\nAverage, All Items (the “CPI”) or its successor index, as\\ndetermined by the Board of Directors. In order to provide\\ntime to determine any applicable increase, the “Year” for\\ndetermining the CPI shall be measured from October 1 through\\nCharleston: 178514 3\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\na\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n \\n\\nhk K 340PG699\\n\\nSeptember 30. Such adjusted Budget shall be the Budget for\\nthe succeeding year, until a new Budget is adopted. Within\\nninety (90) days following the close of the Association\\'s\\nfiscal year, the Board of Directors shall cause an unaudited\\nor audited financial statement, as the Board shall determine,\\nof the Association (the \"Annual Report\") to be prepared by a\\npublic accountant licensed to practice in the State of South\\nCarolina. Upon request, a copy of the Annual Report shall be\\nprovided to any Owner of any Unit which is subject to\\nAssessments.”\\n\\n4. Calculating Consumer Price Index for Assessments. Section\\n6.1.8 includes a provision for automatic adjustment of the maximum\\nannual regular Assessment Share. The adjustment is based on the\\nincrease in the Consumer Price Index for the current calendar year\\nas compared to the preceding calendar year. Because of the timing\\nof the adjustment, it is probable that the Consumer Price Index\\nfor the current calendar year will not then be known. To remedy\\nthis conflict, Section 6.1.8 is deleted and the following re-\\nstated wording is substituted therefor:\\n\\n \\n\\n“6.1.8. Cap_on Regular Assessments; Declarant Subsidy\\n\\nUntil such time as the number of Assessment Shares\\nexceeds 1,000, the maximum annual regular Assessment Share\\nshall not exceed $150; provided, however, that the maximum\\namount that may be assessed shall automatically be increased\\neffective the first day of each fiscal year by an amount that\\nequals the percentage increase during the current Year over\\nthe preceding Year in the Consumer Price Index, all Urban\\nConsumers, United States City Average, All Items (the “CPI”)\\nor its successor index, as determined by the Board of\\nDirectors. In order to provide time to determine any\\napplicable increase, the “Year” for determining the CPI shall\\nbe measured from October 1 through September 30. If the\\nAssessment is not actually increased by the maximum amount in\\nany year, this shall not preclude including the maximum\\namount in calculating the cumulative maximum amount of\\nAssessment Share in a subsequent year. Until such time as the\\nnumber of Assessment Shares exceeds 1,000, if the Assessment\\nShare exceeds the stated maximum, the Declarant’ shall\\ncontribute to the Association such funds as may be required\\nto offset any operating deficit of the Association which\\nexists after subtracting Common Expenses incurred during the\\nyear from Assessments and other revenues received during the\\nyear. This obligation of the Declarant shall not include any\\nobligation for unbudgeted property taxes or assessments, any\\nuninsured loss or claim, or, in the event of an insured loss\\nor claim, any deductible under the insuring policy which is\\npayable by the Association.”\\n\\n \\n\\nCharleston: 178514 4\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n \\n\\nKK 3h0°6709\\n\\n5. Bylaws Amendment Regarding Directors. The Bylaws of the\\nAssociation, recorded as Exhibit B to the Declaration, are\\nunclear regarding the number of Directors that will exist when\\nthe Declarant no longer has a Controlling Interest, as defined in\\nthe Declaration. To clarify this matter, Section 4.2.2 of the\\nBylaws is deleted and the following re-stated wording is\\nsubstituted therefor:\\n\\n \\n\\n“4.2.2. At such time as the Declarant no longer has a\\nControlling Interest, or such earlier time as the Declarant\\nrecords a Supplemental Declaration waiving its authority to\\ndesignate the Board, the successor Board shall be selected as\\nfollows:\\n\\n“A. The successor Board shall consist of three {3)\\nPersons, each of whom shall serve for a three (3) year\\nstaggered term. Initially, one (1) Director shall be elected\\nfor a one (1) year term, one (1) Director shall be elected\\nfor a two (2) year term, and one (1) Director shall be\\nelected for a three (3) year term. The Person receiving the\\nhighest number of votes shall be elected to the three (3)\\nterm, the Person receiving the next highest number of votes\\nshall be elected to the two (2) year term, and the Person\\nreceiving the next highest number of votes shall be elected\\nto the one (1) year term.\\n\\n“B. Thereafter, in the absence of the resignation\\nor replacement of a Director (in which case the replacement\\nDirector shall serve for the balance of the applicable term),\\none (1) Director shall be elected each year for a three (3)\\nyear term, The position of the Director initially holding a\\none (1) year term shall be replaced for the second year and\\nthe position of the Director initially holding a two (2) year\\nterm shall be replaced for the third year. It is not\\nnecessary that a Director be an Owner and there is no limit\\non the number of terms that a Director may serve.\\n\\n“C. The current Board of the Association shall\\nconstitute a Nominating Committee to nominate competent and\\nresponsible Persons to serve as Directors of the Association.\\nAt the discretion of the Board of Directors, elections of\\nDirectors shall be held either (i) by written ballot\\ndistributed to the Owners of Units without a meeting or (ii)\\nby written ballot election at a meeting of the Owners. In all\\ncases, the Board of Directors shall determine the form of the\\nwritten ballot, but the ballot shall contain one or more\\nblank spaces for additional Persons to be nominated. If\\nelection is by written ballot distributed to the Owners of\\nUnits without a meeting, the ballot or accompanying materials\\nshall state a date by which the ballot must be returned to\\nthe Association in order to be counted. If election of\\nDirectors is at a meeting of the Owners, the Association\\n\\nCharleston: 178514 5\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n5\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nKK 340°670)\\n\\nshall cause notice to be given to all Owners that a meeting\\nshall be held at a designated time and place in Charleston\\nCounty not earlier than seven (7) days after the date such\\nnotice is given for election of Directors. The notice shall\\ncontain the names of those persons recommended by the\\nNominating Committee, but shall note that Owners may make\\nother nominations at the meeting.\\n\\n“D. At each election of Directors (and at any\\nother vote of Owners of Units), the Owner of each Unit shall\\nbe entitled to cast a vote for each Unit that is owned by\\nsuch Owner. The weighted number of votes for each Unit Owner\\nshall be the same as the number of Assessment Shares\\nallocable to such Units, as set forth in the Declaration.\\nEach Owner shall be authorized to cast as many votes as the\\nnumber of Directors to be elected (i.e. if three Directors\\nare being elected, then the Owner may cast his votes for\\nthree nominees).\\n\\n“E. If election of Directors is at a meeting of\\nthe Owners, then, after giving the Owners (or written proxy\\nholders) attending such meeting the opportunity to nominate\\nother Persons, with a second by another Owner or proxy\\nholder, the Directors shall be elected by written secret\\nballot.”\\n\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Declarant and the Association have\\nexecuted this Fourth Amendment effective as of the date first\\nstated above.\\n\\nLANDTECH CHARLESTON, LLC\\n\\nWITNESS:\\n\\nBY:\\nBl J.

If the Board fails for any reason to adopt a Budget for the fiscal\\nyear, then until such time as it is adopted, the Budget and Total Assessments in effect for\\nthe current year shall automatically be increased effective the first day of the fiscal year in\\nthe same proportion as any percentage increase during the current Year over the\\npreceding Year, in the Consumer Price Index, all Urban Consumers, United States City\\nAverage, All Items (the “CPI’) or its successor index, as determined by the Board of\\nDirectors. In order to provide time to determine any applicable increase, the “Year” for\\ndetermining the CPI shall be measured from October 1 through September 30. Such\\nadjusted Budget shall be the Budget for the succeeding year, until a new Budget is\\nadopted. Within ninety (90) days following the close of the Association\\'s fiscal year, the\\nBoard of Directors shall cause an unaudited or audited financial statement, as the Board\\nshall determine, of the Association (the \"Annual Report\") to be prepared by a public\\naccouhtant licensed to practice in the State of South Carolina. Upon request, a copy of\\nthe Annual Report shall be provided to any Owner of any Unit which is subject to\\nAssessments.\\n\\n6.1.2. Determining the Budget\\n\\nThe Budget and the Total Assessments shall be based upon annual estimates by\\nthe Board of Directors of the Association\\'s revenues and its cash requirements to pay all\\nestimated expenses and costs arising out of or connected with the use, maintenance and\\noperation of the Common Area and Area of Common Responsibility and the operation of\\nthe Agsociation. Such estimated expenses and costs may include, among other things,\\nthe following: expenses of management, including compensation of any Management\\nAgent; taxes and special assessments; insurance premiums; repairs and maintenance;\\nwages and personnel expenses for Association employees; utility charges; legal and\\n\\nCharleston: 178514-4 7\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nBN & 9276026\\n\\naccounting fees; any deficit remaining from a previous period; creation of one or more\\nreasonable contingency reserves and/or sinking funds; any principal and interest\\npayments due for debts of the Association; and any other expenses, costs and existing or\\nprojected liabilities which may be incurred by the Association for the benefit of the Owners\\npursuant to this Declaration. Such expenses and costs shall constitute the Common\\nExpenses.\\n\\n6.1.3. Allocation of Assessments\\n\\n    \\n\\nCondominium Units.\\n\\nThe Owner of each Residential Unit shall pay one (1) Assessment Share, as‘\\ndefined in Section 6.1.4., below. For Assessment purposes, a Residential Unit shall be\\ndeemed to exist at such time as a subdivision plat showing the location of the Unit is\\nrecoded.\\n\\n    \\n\\nThe Owner of each tment Unit or Condominium Unit shall pay one fourth (1/4)\\nof one (1) Assessment Share, as defined in Section 6.1.4., below. In the case of a\\nCondominium Unit, the condominium regime for such Condominium Unit shall collect and\\npay to the Association the Assessment for all Condominium Units in the condominium\\nregime unless the Association agrees, in writing, to collect such Assessments directly\\nfrom the Owner of each Condominium Unit. For Assessment purposes, an Apartment\\nUnit shall be deemed to exist at such time as a Final Site Plan for the non-residential use\\nis approved by the Town of Mount Pleasant and recorded in the Office of the Register of\\nMesne Conveyances for Charleston County; provided, however, if the Owner fails to\\nrecord the Final Site Plan, the Association may determine that the Apartment Unit is\\nnevertheless subject to the Assessments. For Assessment purposes, a Condominium\\nUnit shall be deemed to exist at such time as a master deed is recorded by the\\ncondominium regime in the Office of the Register of Mesne Conveyances for Charleston\\nCounty; provided, however, if the condominium regime fails to record the master deed,\\nthe Association may determine that the Condominium Unit is nevertheless subject to the\\nAssessments.\\n\\nFor example, a building (or buildings) containing 40 Apartment Units or 40\\nCondominium Units shall be assigned ten (10) Assessment Shares.\\n\\n   \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n   \\n\\n(A) There shall be two (2) types of ‘esidential Units, Standard\\nNon-Residential Units and Flexible Non-Residential Units. Flexible Non-\\nResidential Units shail be buildings determined by the Association to be permitted\\nand utilized primarily for storage and warehousing purposes, and which have no\\nmore than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total improvements as offices,\\nshowroom or display space, common areas, or intemal amenities.

If there is a change in uses of a Non-Residential building, the\\nAssociation shall have the right to change the designation of a Non-Residential\\nUnit.\\n\\n(B) The Owners of both Standard and Flexible Non-Residential Units shall\\npay (a) one twentieth (1/20) of one (1) Assessment Share, as defined in Section\\n6.1.4., below, for each 1,000 square feet of unimproved Non-Residential Unit land,\\nand any fraction thereof, and whether or not \"developable\" or shown upon a°\\nrecorded plat. For the purpose of Section 6.1.3.3 only, parking lots, parking\\ngarages, pathways, roadways or driveways, landscaped areas, and such other\\nelements as may be approved in writing by the Association, shall be deemed\\n“unimproved” land. Any land area which is not occupied by improvements shall\\nalso be deemed \"unimproved.\"\\n\\n(C) In addition to the Assessment allocable to unimproved Non-Residential!\\nUnit land set forth in (B), above (i) Standard Non-Residential Units shall pay one\\n(1) Assessment Share for each 1,000 square feet of gross floor area of Non-\\nResidential improvements, and any fraction thereof; and (ii) Flexible Non-\\nResidential Units shall pay one-tenth (110\") of one (1) Assessment Share for\\neach 1,000 square feet of gross floor area of Non-Residential improvements, and\\nany fraction thereof.\\n\\n(D) For purposes of (A) and (C), above, \"improvements\" shall mean any\\nstructure intended for commercial or industrial use and occupancy, as permitted\\nby this Declaration and applicable laws, and for which an initial certificate of\\noccupancy or completion has been issued or which is substantially complete as\\ndetermined by the general contractor or architect, whichever is earlier. The term\\n“improvements” shall not include golf courses, parking lots, parking garages,\\nroadways or driveways, or utility lines and related non-habitable utility facllities.\\n\\nFor example, a 100,000 square foot unimproved Non-Residential Unit\\n(whether a Standard or Flexible Non-Residential Unit) shalt be assigned 5\\nAssessment Shares.\\n\\nThe same 100,000 square foot Non-Residential Unit (land) with a two story\\noffice buikiing containing 50,000 square feet of gross floor area located on\\n25,000 square feet of land shall be assigned 53.75 Assessment Shares\\n(3.75 Assessment Shares for 75,000 square feet of unimproved land plus\\n50 Assessment Shares for 50,000 square feet of improved gross floor\\narea).\\n\\n19\\nCharteston: 178514-4\\n\\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nE\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\naN &92P6028\\n\\nThe same 100,000 square foot Non-Residential Unit (land) with a\\nwarehouse or storage building containing 50,000 square feet of gross floor\\narea located on 25,000 square feet of the land shall be assigned 8.75\\nAssessment Shares (3.75 Assessment Shares for 75,000 square feet of\\nunimproved land plus 5 Assessment Shares for 50,000 square feet of\\nimproved gross floor area).\\n\\n6.1.4. Calculating the Assessments\\nTo determine the number of Assessment Shares and the allocable Assessment for :\\neach type of Unit for the fiscal year, the Board of Directors shall:\\n\\nA. Determine the total number of Residential Units existing at the beginning of the\\napplicable fiscal year. This total is the \"Assessed Residential Units.\" Multiply the\\nnumber of Assessed Residential Units by one (1).\\n\\nB. Determine the total number of Apartment Units and Condominium Units existing\\nat the beginning of the applicable fiscal year. This total is the \"Assessed Apartment\\nand Condominium Units.\" Divide the number of Assessed Apartment Units and\\nCondominium Units by four (4).\\n\\nC. Determine, in accordance with Section 6.1.1.3, the Assessment Shares\\nallocable to Non-Residential Units.\\n\\nD. Determine the sum of A, B and C. This constitutes the \"Total Assessment\\nShares”.\\n\\nE. Divide the Total Assessments required for the fiscal year by the Total\\nAssessment Shares to determine the amount of one (1) Assessment Share. Each\\nResidential Unit will pay one (1) Assessment Share. Each Apartment Unit and\\nCondominium Unit will pay one fourth (1/4) of one (1) Assessment Share. Non-\\nResidential Units will pay the appropriate Assessment as calculated in Section\\n6.1.3.3.\\n\\n[Exampie: Assume that (i) the Budget of the Association for the forthcoming fiscal\\nyear is $150,000; (ii) there are 500 Assessed Residential Units, (lil) there are 600\\nAssessed Apartment and Condominium Units and (iii) the Assessment Shares\\nallocable to Non-Residential Units has been determined to be 400. The Total\\nAssessment Shares are (w) 500 for Residential Units, plus (x) 150 for Apartment\\nand Condominium Units (600 divided by 4), plus (y) 400 for Non-Residential Units,\\n\\n20\\nCharleston: 178514-4\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\na\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\naN 492PG029\\n\\nor (Z) a total of 1,050 Assessment Shares. Thus, each Assessment Share for the\\nyear is $150,000 divided by the number of Total Assessed Units (1,050), or\\n$142.86.\\n\\n \\n\\n6.1.5. Assessments for Units Not Existing at Beginning\\nof Fiscal Year\\nIf a Unit is created after the beginning of the fiscal year, then the applicable\\nAssessment for such Unit shall be pro-rated and shall be payable for the balance of the\\ncurrent fiscal year beginning on the first calendar day of the month following the creation\\nof such Unit. To determine when a Unit is deemed to be created, see the definition of the\\nUnit type under Section 1.1.\\n\\n6.1.6. Assessments for Units Owned by Declarant\\n\\nDeclarant and Affiliates of Declarant shall pay Assessments on Units owned by\\nthem in the same manner as other Unit Owners; provided, however, that the Declarant\\nmay elect, in lieu of paying Assessments, to contribute to the Association from time to\\ntime such funds as may be required to offset any operating deficit of the Association\\nwhich exists after subtracting Common Expenses incurred during the year from\\nAssessments and other revenues received during the year. Unless the Declarant notifies\\nthe Association otherwise by March 1 of the applicable fiscal year, the Declarant shall be\\ndeemed to have elected to continue paying on the same basis as during the preceding\\nfiscal year.\\n\\n6.1.7. Notice and Payment of Assessments\\n\\n6.1.7.1. Notice.\\n\\nUniess the Board of Directors elects a shorter payment period, the Assessments\\nshall be due on a calendar year basis in advance. Unless otherwise determined by the\\nBoard of Directors, the Association shall, by December 15, fumish to each Owner of a\\nResidential Unit, each Owner of a participating Apartment Unit and Participating Non-\\nResidential Unit, and each participating condominium regime a copy of the Budget for the\\nforthcoming fiscal year and a statement of the amount of the Assessment payable by\\nsuch Owner. Where mutually agreed by the Association and the board of directors of any\\nSubordinate Association of Units, the Association may send such information as is\\napplicable to Owners in the Subordinate Association directly to such subordinate\\nassociation, and the subordinate association shall act as the Assessments\\ncommunication, billing and collection agent for the Owners in such subordinate\\nassociation; provided that such agreement shall not relieve any Owner of a Residential\\nUnit from its obligations under this Declaration.\\n\\nCharteston: 178514-4 21\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n2\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nBR N &92PG030\\n\\n6.17.2.

Cap on Regular Assessments; Declarant Subsidy\\n\\nUntil such time as the number of Assessment Shares exceeds 1,000, the\\nmaximum annual regular Assessment Share shall not exceed $150; provided, however,\\nthat the maximum amount that may be assessed shall automatically be increased\\neffective the first day of each fiscal year by an amount that equals the percentage\\nincrease during the current Year over the preceding Year in the Consumer Price Index,\\nall Urban Consumers, United States City Average, All Items (the “CPI”) or its successor\\nindex, as determined by the Board of Directors. In order to provide time to determine\\nany applicable increase, the “Year” for determining the CPI shall be measured from\\nOctober 1 through September 30. If the Assessment is not actually increased by the\\nmaximum amount in any year, this shall not preciude including the maximum amount in\\ncalculating the cumulative maximum amount of Assessment Share in a subsequent\\nyear. Until such time as the number of Assessment Shares exceeds 1,000, if the\\nAssessment Share exceeds the stated maximum, the Declarant shall contribute to the\\nAssociation such funds as may be required to offset any operating deficit of the\\nAssociation which exists after subtracting Common Expenses incurred during the year\\nfrom Assessments and other revenues received during the year. This obligation of the\\nDeclarant shall not include any obligation for unbudgeted property taxes or\\nassessments, any uninsured loss or claim, or, in the event of an insured loss or claim,\\nany deductible under the insuring policy which is payable by the Association.\\n\\n___ 6.2, SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS\\n\\nIn addition to the regular Assessments authorized above, the Board of Directors\\nmay levy one or more Special Assessments which cumulatively do not exceed Fifty\\nDollars ($50.00) per Assessment Share during any fiscal year. In addition, the Board of\\nDirectors may levy one or more Special Assessments to cover the cost of any\\nunbudgeted property taxes or assessments or, in the event of an insured loss or event,\\nany deductible amount under the insuring policy. (Special Assessments for Apartment,\\nCondominium and Non-Residential Units shall be in the same proportion as the portion of\\nthe Assessment Share which is allocable to such Units, as set forth in Section 6.1.4.)

Special Assessments shall be payable by the date determined by the\\nBoard of Directors, but no earller than fourteen (14) days after notice of such Assessment\\nshall have been given to the Owner in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section\\n7.11 of this Declaration.\\n\\n \\n\\nAny Assessment which is not paid to the Association when due by an Owner shall:\\nbe delinquent. All delinquent Assessments shall incur an administrative charge of $10.00\\nper month or any portion of any month from the date each such installment is due until\\nsuch payment is received by the Association, in addition to any interest charges which\\nmay be payable. No Owner may waive or otherwise escape liability of the Assessments\\nprovided for herein by non-use of the Common Area or abandonment of his Unit.\\n\\n \\n\\nAssessments, including Special Assessments, interest and charges thereon, and\\ncosts of collection thereof (including reasonable attomeys\\' fees and expenses) shall be (i)\\nthe personal obligation of the Person who was the Owner of such Unit at the time when\\nthe assessment fell due and, unless expressly agreed by the Board of Directors of the\\nAssociation, also of any subsequent Owner, (ii) a charge on the Unit to which such\\nassessments are applicable and (iii) a continuing lien upon each Unit in favor of the\\nAssociation. To evidence a lien for sums assessed pursuant to this Section, the\\nAssociation may prepare a written notice of lien setting forth the amount of the unpaid\\nAssessment or Special Assessment, the due date, the amount remaining unpaid, the\\nname of the Owner of the Unit, and a description of the Unit. Such notice shall be signed\\nand acknowledged by a duly authorized officer of the Association or any Managing Agent\\nof the Association and may be recorded in the office of the Register of Mesne\\nConveyances for Charleston County. No notice of lien shall be recorded until there is a\\ndelinquency in payment of the Assessment. Such lien may be enforced as set forth in\\nSection 6.9.\\n\\n——___-§.5. SURORDIMATION OF THE LIEN\\n\\nThe lien of the Assessments provided for herein shail be subordinate to the lien of\\nany unpaid taxes and any recorded mortgage on the applicable Unit. Sale or transfer of\\nany Unit shall not affect the lien of the Assessments. However, the sale or transfer of any\\nUnit which is subject to any recorded mortgage, pursuant to a decree of foreclosure under\\nsuch mortgage or any proceeding or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure thereof, shall\\nextinguish the lien of the Assessments as to payment thereof, which became due prior to\\n\\nCharleston: 178514-4 23\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n N &492P6032\\n\\nsuch sale or transfer.

Theee changes\\nInclude placing fill material in 0.304 acres of Jurisdictional wetlands and 9.062 acree of upiand\\nbuffer mitigation area associated with permit #94-1T-178 in order to construct a necessary\\nalternative access road from US Highway 17 to 2 12 acre tract of land for development of a\\ncommercial center to ba known as The Shoppes at Park West. The applicant has stated that\\nthe alternative access to the property from US Highway 17 is critical to the commercial\\ndevelopment of the property. The safe and efficient travel of trucks and vendors servicing the\\nplanned grocery and retail development is dependent upon an alternative access that does not\\nutilize Park West Boulevard and avoids mixing of commercial traffic with pedestrian, residential\\nand schoo! traffic, including school buses. The Town of Mt. Pleasant and Park West .\\nDevelopment, inc. support the proposed aitemative access road. As mitigation for the previous\\nmitigation and proposed impacts, the applicant proposes to preserve and enhance 0.191 acres\\nof jurisdictional wetlands previousty permitted for clearing under $4-1T-178 arid the\\nestablishment of 0.676 acres of additional upland buffers within the Park West Development, in\\naddition to the purchase of 2.5 credits from an apcropriate approved mitigation bank.\\n\\nThis is to inform you that your request for madification is granted.

Any\\nland area which is not occupied by improvements shall be deemed\\n\"unimproved.\" A \"Non-Residential Unit\" shall exist at such time as\\na Final Site Plan for the non-residential use is approved by the\\nTown of Mount Pleasant and recorded in the Office of the Register\\nof Mesne Conveyances for Charleston County; provided, however, if\\nthe Owner fails to record the Final Site Plan, the Association may\\ndetermine that the property is nevertheless subject to the\\nAssessments. The Association shall have the right to determine\\nwhether a Non-Residential Unit exists and how many Non-Residential\\nUnits exist at a particular time, subject to the provisions of this\\nDeclaration.\\n\\nFor example, a 100,000 square foot unimproved Non-residential\\nUnit shall be assigned five (5) Assessment Shares. The same\\n100,000 square foot Nonresidential Unit with a two story\\noffice building containing 50,000 square feet of gross floor\\narea located on 25,000 square feet of the land shall be\\nassigned 53.75 Assessment Shares (3.75 Assessment Shares for\\n75,000 square feet of unimproved land plus 50 Assessment\\nShares for 50,000 square feet of gross floor area).\\n\\nCHAR: 116018\\n16 12/12/97\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nkK P 294P6295\\n\\n6.1.4. Calculating the Assessments\\n\\nTo determine the number of Assessment Shares and the allocable\\nAssessment for each type of Unit for the fiscal year, the Board of\\nDirectors shall:\\n\\nA. Determine the total number of Residential Units\\nexisting at the beginning of the applicable fiscal year. This\\ntotal is the \"Assessed Residential Units.\" Multiply the number\\nof Assessed Residential Units by one (1).\\n\\nB. Determine the total number of Apartment Units and\\nCondominium Units existing at the beginning of the applicable\\nfiscal year. This total is the \"Assessed Apartment and\\nCondominium Units:\" Divide the number of Assessed Apartment\\nUnits and Condominium Units by four (4).\\n\\nC. Determine, in accordance with Section 6.1.1.3, the\\nAssessment Shares allocable to Non-Residential Units.\\n\\nD. Determine the sum of A, B and C. This constitutes the\\n\"Total Assessment Shares\".\\n\\nE. Divide the Total Assessments required for the fiscal\\nyear by the Total Assessment Shares to determine the amount of\\none (1) Assessment Share. Each Residential Unit will pay one\\n(1) Assessment Share. Each Apartment Unit and Condominium Unit\\nwill pay one fourth (1/4) of one (1) Assessment Share. Non-\\nResidential Units will pay the appropriate Assessment as\\ncalculated in Section 6.1.3.3.\\n\\n{Example: Assume that (i) the Budget of the Association\\nfor the forthcoming fiscal year is $150,000; (ii) there\\nare 500 Assessed Residential Units, (iii) there are 600\\nAssessed Apartment and Condominium Units and (iii) the\\nAssessment Shares allocable to Non-Residential Units has\\nbeen determined to be 400. The Total Assessment Shares\\nare (w) 500 for Residential Units, plus (x) 150 for\\nApartment and Condominium Units (600 divided by 4), plus\\n(y) 400 for Non-Residential Units, or (z) a total of\\n1,050 Assessment Shares. Thus, each Assessment Share for\\nthe year is $150,000 divided by the number of Total\\nAssessed Units (1,050), or $142.86.\\n\\nNOTE: The Assessment calculations sho ovide a mathematica\\nexample only. They are not intended to be estimates of the number\\nof Units of different types or the actual Assessment which may be\\napplicable from time to time.\\n\\n6.1.5.

Sorrento, Director\\n\\nDepartment of Defense - Manpower Data Center\\n400 Gigling Rd.\\n\\nSeaside, CA 93955\\n\\n \\n\\nV8ZS00TdD2Z07#ASVD - SVA1d NONWOD - NOLSATYVHO - Wd 92: ST AON 2202 - GA1la ATIVOINOYLOATA\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\na\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nThe Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) is an organization of the Department of Defense (DoD) that maintains the Defense Enrollment and Eligibility\\nReporting System (DEERS) database which is the official source of data on eligibility for military medical care and other eligibility systems.\\n\\nThe DoD strongly supports the enforcement of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 USC App. § 3901 et seq, as amended) (SCRA) (formerly known as\\nthe Soldiers’ and Sailors\\' Civil Relief Act of 1940). DMDG has issued hundreds of thousands of \"does not possess any information indicating that the\\nindividual is currently on active duty\" responses, and has experienced only a small error rate. In the event the individual referenced above, or any family\\nmember, friend, or representative asserts in any manner that the individual was on active duty for the active duty status date, or is otherwise entitled to the\\nprotections of the SCRA, you are strongly encouraged to obtain further verification of the person\\'s status by contacting that person\\'s Service. Service contact\\ninformation can be found on the SCRA website\\'s FAQ page (Q35) via this URL: https://scra.dmdc.osd.mil/scra/#/taqs. If you have evidence the person\\n\\nwas on active duty for the active duty status date and you fail to obtain this additional Service verification, punitive provisions of the SCRA may be invoked\\nagainst you. See 50 USC App. § 3921(c).\\n\\nThis response reflects the following information: (1) The individual\\'s Active Duty status on the Active Duty Status Date (2) Whether the individual left Active\\nDuty status within 367 days preceding the Active Duty Status Date (3) Whether the individual or his/her unit received early notification to report for active\\nduty on the Active Duty Status Date.\\n\\nMore information on \"Active Duty Status\"\\n\\nActive duty status as reported in this certificate is defined in accordance with 10 USC § 101(d) (1). Prior to 2010 only some of the active duty periods less\\nthan 30 consecutive days in length were available. In the case of a member of the National Guard, this includes service under a call to active service\\nauthorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense under 32 USC § 502(f) for purposes of responding to a national emergency declared by the\\nPresident and supported by Federal funds. All Active Guard Reserve (AGR) members must be assigned against an authorized mobilization position in the\\nunit they support. This includes Navy Training and Administration of the Reserves (TARs), Marine Corps Active Reserve (ARs) and Coast Guard Reserve\\nProgram Administrator (RPAs). Active Duty status also applies to a Uniformed Service member who is an active duty commissioned officer of the U.S.\\nPublic Health Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA Commissioned Corps).\\n\\nCoverage Under the SCRA is Broader in Some Cases\\n\\nCoverage under the SCRA is broader in some cases and includes some categories of persons on active duty for purposes of the SCRA who would not be\\nteported as on Active Duty under this certificate. SCRA protections are for Title 10 and Title 14 active duty records for all the Uniformed Services periods.\\nTitle 32 periods of Active Duty are not covered by SCRA, as defined in accordance with 10 USC § 101(d)(1).\\n\\nMany times orders are amended to extend the period of active duty, which would extend SCRA protections. Persons seeking to rely on this website\\ncertification should check to make sure the orders on which SCRA protections are based have not been amended to extend the inclusive dates of service.\\nFurthermore, some protections of the SCRA may extend to persons who have received orders to report for active duty or to be inducted, but who have not _\\nactually begun active duty or actually reported for induction. The Last Date on Active Duty entry is important because a number of protections of the SCRA\\nextend beyond the last dates of active duty.\\n\\nThose who could rely on this certificate are urged to seek qualified legal counsel to ensure that all rights guaranteed to Service members under the SCRA\\nare protected\\n\\nWARNING: This certificate was provided based on a last name, SSN/date of birth, and active duty status date provided by the requester. Providing\\nerroneous information will cause an erroneous certificate to be provided.\\n\\nV8ZS00TdD2Z07#ASVD - SVA1d NONWOD - NOLSATYVHO - Wd 92: ST AON 2202 - GA1la ATIVOINOYLOATA\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n  \\n\\n2\\no\\n<\\nB\\na\\nKEVIN MURPHY\\nAccount Number a! 3046 Customer Service: 1-866-450-\\n\\nSummary of Account Activi neil)\\nPrevious Balance $7,048.83 New Balance\\n\\n+ Fees Charged $40.00 Amount Past Due\\n\\n+ Interest Charged $159.08 Total Minimum Payment Due\\n\\nNew Balance $7,247.91 Overlimit Amount\\n\\nPayment Due Date IO\\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\nVisit us at Seer Fee nee Bie\\n24\\n\\nSeo i reali ee Oo Late Payment Warning:!f we do not receive your Total [—\\net - Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date listed = [7]\\nCash Limit $1,418.00 above, you may have to pay a late fee up to $40.00. n\\nAvailable Cash $0.00 Minimum Payment Warning: If you make only the miningg™m\\nStatement Closing Date 05/16/2022 payment each period, you will pay more in interest and it wil?\\nDays in Billing Cycle 31 take you longer to pay off your balance.

[f Lender determines that any part of\\nthe Property is subject to a lien which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender may give Borrower a\\nnolice identifying the lien. Within 10 days of the date on which that notice is given, Borrower shall satisfy the licn or take\\none or more of the actions set forth above in this Section 4.\\n\\nLender may require Borrower to pay a one-time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or reporting service used\\nby Lender in connection with this Loan.\\n\\n5.

This insurance shail be maintained in the\\namounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the\\npreceding sentences can change during the term of the Loan. The insurance carrier providing the insurance shall be\\nchosen by Borrower subject to Lender\\'s right to disapprove Borrower\\'s choice, which right shall not be exercised\\nunrcasonably. Lender may require Borrower to pay, in connection with this Loan, cither: (a) a one-time charge for flood\\nzone determination, certification and tracking services; or (b) a one-time charge for flood zone determination and\\ncertification services and subsequent charges cach time remappings or similar changes occur which reasonably might\\naffect such determination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of any fces imposed by the\\nFederal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone determination resulting from\\nan objection by Borrower.\\n\\nIf Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at\\nLender\\'s option and Borrower\\'s expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount of\\ncoverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might not protect Borrower, Borrower\\'s equity in the\\nProperty, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage\\nthan was previously in effect. Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained might\\nsignificantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under\\nthis Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear\\ninterest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender\\nto Borrower requesting payment.\\n\\nAll insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender\\'s right to\\ndisapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an\\nadditional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and renewal certificates. If Lender requires,\\nBorrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form\\nof insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such policy shall\\ninclude a standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.\\n\\nIn the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carricr and Lender, Lender may make proof\\nof loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree in writing, any insurance\\nproceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall be applicd to restoration or repair of the\\nProperty, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender\\'s security is not lessened. During such repair and\\nrestoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to\\ninspect such Property to ensure the work has becn completcd to Lender\\'s satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall\\nbe undertaken prompuy. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a serics of\\nprogress payments as the work is completed, Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest\\nto be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or carnings on such\\nproceeds, Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower shall not be paid out of the insurance\\nprocceds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower.

Such insurance proceeds shall be applicd in the order\\nprovided for in Section 2.\\n\\nIf Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance claim and related\\nmatters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the insurance carrier has offered to\\nsettle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day period will begin when the notice is given.

Whether or not\\nBorrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain the Property in order to prevent the Property from\\ndeteriorating or decreasing in valuc due to its condition. Unless it is determined pursuant to Section 5 that repair or\\nrestoration is not economically feasible, Borrower shall promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further\\ndeterioration or damage. If insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid in connection with damage lo, or the taking of,\\nthe Property, Borrower shall be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender has rcleased proceeds\\nfor such purposes, Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of\\nprogress payments as the work is completed. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or\\nrestore the Property, Borrower is not relieved of Borrower\\'s obligation for the completion of such repair or restoration,\\n\\nLender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If it has reasonable cause,\\nLender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender shall give Borrower notice at the time of or\\nprior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.\\n\\n8. Borrower\\'s Loan Application, Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application process, Borrower\\nor any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower\\'s knowledge or consent gave materially\\nfalse, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with material\\ninformation) in connection with the Loan. Material representations include, but are nol limited to, representations\\nconcerning Borrower\\'s occupancy of the Property as Borrower\\'s principal residence.\\n\\n9, Protection of Lender\\'s Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument. If\\n(a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there is a legal\\nproceeding that might significantly affect Lender\\'s interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument\\n(such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien which may attain\\npriority over this Securily Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then\\nLender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights\\nunder this Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property, and securing and/or\\nrepairing the Property. Lender\\'s actions can include, but are not limited to: (a) paying any sums secured by a lien which\\nhas priority over this Security Instrument; (b) appearing in court; and (c) paying reasonable attorneys’ fees to protect its\\ninterest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured position in a bankruptcy\\nproceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to make repairs, change locks,\\nreplace or board up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, climinate building or other code violations or dangerous\\nconditions, and have utilities turned on or off. Although Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender docs not\\nhave to do so and is not under any duty or obligation to do so. IL is agreed that Lender incurs no liability for not taking\\nany or all actions authorized under this Section 9.\\n\\nAny amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this\\nSecurity Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be\\npayable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.\\n\\nIf this Security Instrument is on a leaschold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of the lease. If Borrower\\nacquires fee lille to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge unless Lender agrees to the merger in\\nwriting.\\n\\n10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan, Borrower\\nshall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If, for any reason, the Mortgage Insurance\\ncoverage required by Lender ccases to be available from the mortgage insurer thal previously provided such insurance\\nand Borrower was required to make separatcly designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance,\\nBorrower shall pay the premiums required to obtain coverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance\\npreviously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in\\neffect, from an alternate mortgage insurer sclected by Lender. If substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is\\nnol available, Borrower shall conlinuc to pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were duc\\nwhen the insurance coverage ccased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these payments as a non-refundable\\nloss reserve in licu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve sha!l be non-refundable, notwithstanding the fact that the\\nLoan is ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or carnings on such loss\\nreserve. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the amount and for the\\nperiod that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender\\nrequires separatcly designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage\\nInsurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward\\nthe premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required 10 maintain Mortgage Insurance in\\neffect, or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until Lender\\'s requirernent for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance\\nwith any written agrecment between Borrower and Lender providing for such termination or until termination is required\\nby Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 10 affects Borrower\\'s obligation to pay interest al the rate provided in the\\nNote.\\n\\nMortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it may incur if\\nBorrower docs not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party lo the Mortgage Insurance.\\n\\nSOUTH CAROLINA--Single Family--Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT (MERS) Form 3041 1/01\\n\\nMERS Mortgage-SC\\n2006A-SC (08/08) Page 5 of 9\\n\\n \\n\\nTST 5d 9PTO 48 DWH\\n\\n«5 6d\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n5\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n \\n\\nDOC ID #: 00022642571309010\\n\\nMortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may enter into\\nagreements with other partics that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agrecments are on terms and\\nconditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other party (or partics) to these agreements. These\\nagreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer may\\nhave available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums).\\n\\nAs a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any reinsurer, any other entity,\\nor any affiliatc of any of the foregoing, may reccive (directly or indirectly) amounts that derive from (or might be\\ncharacterized as) a portion of Borrower\\'s payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or modifying the\\nmortgage insurer\\'s risk, or reducing losses. If such agreement provides that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the\\ninsurer\\'s risk in exchange for a share of the premiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often termed \"captive\\nreinsurance,\" Further:\\n\\n(a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for Mortgage\\nInsurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the amount Borrower will owe for\\nMortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund.\\n\\n(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has - if any - with respect to the Mortgage\\nInsurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other law. These rights may include the right to\\nreceive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage Insurance, to have the Mortgage\\nInsurance terminated automatically, and/or to receive a refund of any Mortgage Insurance premiums that were\\nunearned at the time of such cancellation or termination.\\n\\n11. Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture. All Misccllancous Proceeds are hercby assigned to and\\nshall be paid to Lender.\\n\\nIf the Property is damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if\\nthe restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender\\'s security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration\\nperiod, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellancous Proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect\\nsuch Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender\\'s satisfaction, provided that such inspection shall be\\nundertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of progress\\npayments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid\\non such Misccllancous Proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such\\nMiscellancous Proceeds. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender\\'s security would be Iessened,\\nthe Miscellancous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due,\\nwith the excess, if any, paid to Borrower, Such Misccilancous Proceeds shall be applicd in the order provided for in\\nSection 2.\\n\\nIn the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in valuc of the Property, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be\\napplicd to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to\\nBorrower.\\n\\nIn the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of the\\nProperty immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or greater than the amount of the\\nsums secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in valuc, unless\\nBorrower and Lender otherwise agrce in writing, the sums secured by this Sccurily Instrument shall be reduced by the\\namount of the Misccllancous Proceeds multiplied by the following fraction: (a) the total amount of the sums secured\\nimmediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value divided by (b) the fair markct value of the Property\\nimmediatcly before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value. Any balance shall be paid to Borrower.\\n\\nIn the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market valuc of the\\nProperly immediatcly before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the amount of the sums secured\\nimmediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in valuc, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in\\nwriting, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument whether or not the\\nsums are then duc.\\n\\nIf the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the Opposing Party\\n(as defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages, Borrower fails to respond to\\nLender within 30 days after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorizcd to collect and apply the Miscellaneous\\nProceeds cither to restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not\\nthen due. \"Opposing Party\" means the third party that owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom\\nBorrower has a right of action in regard to Misccllancous Proceeds.\\n\\nBorrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in Lender\\'s\\njudgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender\\'s interest in the Property or\\nrights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if acceleration has occurred, reinstate as\\nprovided in Section 19, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a ruling that, in Lender\\'s judgment,\\nprecludes forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender\\'s interest in the Property or rights under this\\nSecurity Instrument. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the impairment of Lender\\'s\\ninterest in the Property are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender.\\n\\nAll Miscellancous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be applicd in the order\\nprovided for in Section 2.\\n\\n12, Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time for payment or\\nmodification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to Borrower or any\\nSuccessor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower or any Successors in Interest of\\nBorrower. Lender shall not be required to commence procecdings against any Successor in Interest of Borrower or to\\nrefuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by\\nreason of any demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower.

Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants and agrces\\nthat Borrower\\'s obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who co-signs this Security\\nInstrument but does not execute the Note (a \"co-signer\"): (a) is co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage,\\ngrant and convey the co-signer\\'s interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally\\nobligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can\\nagree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the\\nNolte without the co-signer\\'s consent.\\n\\nSubject to the provisions of Section 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrower\\'s obligations\\nunder this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall obtain all of Borrower\\'s rights and benefits\\nunder this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from Borrower\\'s obligations and lability under this\\nSecurity Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing. The covenants and agreements of this Security\\nInstrument shall bind (except as provided in Section 20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender.\\n\\n14, Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with Borrowcr\\'s\\ndefault, for the purpose of protecting Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights under this Sccurity Instrument, including,\\nbul not limited to, attorneys’ fees, property inspection and vatuation fees. In regard to any other fees, the absence of\\nexpress authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific fee 10 Borrower shall not be construcd as a prohibition\\non the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Sccurity Instrument or by\\nApplicable Law.\\n\\nIf the Loan is subject to a law which scts maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that the\\ninterest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the permitted limits, then:\\n(a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (6) any\\nsums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose\\nto makc this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund\\nreduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a\\nprepayment charge is provided for under the Note). Borrower\\'s acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to\\nBorrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.\\n\\n15. Notices, All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be in\\nwriting. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to\\nBorrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower\\'s notice address if sent by other means.\\nNotice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise.\\nThe notice address shall be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to\\nLender. Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower\\'s change of address. If Lender specifies a procedure for\\nreporting Borrower\\'s change of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that specified\\nprocedure. There may be only one designated notice address under this Security Instrument at any onc time. Any notice to\\nLender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender\\'s address stated hercin unless Lender\\nhas designated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument shall not be\\ndeemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender. If any notice required by this Sccurity Instrument\\nis also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under\\nthis Security Instrument.\\n\\n16. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall be governed by federal\\nlaw and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All rights and obligations contained in this Security\\nInstrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or\\nimplicitly allow the partics to agree by contract or it might be silent, but such silence shall not be construed as a\\nprohibition against agreement by contract. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security Instrument or the Note\\nconflicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shail not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note\\nwhich can be given effect without the conflicting provision.\\n\\nAs uscd in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include corresponding neuter\\nwords or words of the feminine gender; (b) words in (he singular shall mean and include the plural and vice versa; and\\n(c) the word \"may\" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take any action.\\n\\n17.

As uscd in this Section 18, “Interest in the\\nProperty\" means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to, those beneficial interests\\ntransferred in a bond for deed, contract for decd, installment sales contract or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the\\ntransfer of ule by Borrower at a future date to a purchaser.\\n\\nTf all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural\\nperson and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender\\'s prior written consent, Lender may\\nrequire immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall not be\\nexercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.\\n\\nIf Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a period\\nof not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay\\nall sums secured by this Security Insuument. [f Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period,\\nLender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.\\n\\n19. Borrower\\'s Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions, Borrower shall\\nhave the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time prior to the carliest of: (a) five\\ndays before sale of the Property pursuant to Section 22 of this Security Instrument; (b) such other period as Applicable\\nLaw might specify for the termination of Borrower\\'s right to reinstate; or (c) entry of a judgment enforcing this Security\\nInstrument.

Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement\\nsums and expenses in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) moncy order; (c) certified\\ncheck, bank check, treasurer\\'s check or cashier\\'s check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose\\ndeposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer. Upon reinstatement\\nby Borrower, this Security Instrument and obligations secured hereby shall remain fully effective as if no acceleration had\\noccurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not apply in the case of acccleration under Section 18.\\n\\n20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial interest in the Note\\n(together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might\\nresult in a change in the entity (known as the \"Loan Servicer\") that collects Periodic Payments duc under the Note and\\nthis Security Instrument and performs other mortgage foan servicing obligations under the Note, this Security Instrument,\\nand Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. If\\nthere is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will state the name and\\naddress of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments should be made and any other information RESPA\\nrequires in connection with a notice of transfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by a\\nLoan Servicer other than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations to Borrower will remain with\\nthe Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not assumed by the Note purchaser unless\\notherwise provided by the Note purchaser,\\n\\nNeither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as cither an individual\\nlitigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party\\'s actions pursuant to this Security Instrument or that\\nalleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of, this Security Instrument, until\\nsuch Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such notice given in compliance with the requirements of\\nSection 15) of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice\\nto take corrective action. If Applicable Law provides a time period which must clapse before certain action can be taken,\\nthat time period will be decmed to be reasonable for purposes of this paragraph. The notice of acceleration and\\nopportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to\\nSection 18 shall be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 20,\\n\\n21.

The preceding two sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the\\nProperty of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognizcd to be appropriate to normal residential\\nuses and to maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products).\\n\\nBorrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or other action\\nby any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance or\\nEnvironmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any Environmental Condition, including but not limited\\nto, any spilling, leaking, discharge, rclease or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) any condition caused\\nby the presence, use or release of a Hazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower\\nlearns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or other\\nremediation of any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all necessary\\nremedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on Lender for an\\nEnvironmental Cleanup.\\n\\nNON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:\\n\\n22. Acceleration; Remedics. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower\\'s\\nbreach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to acceleration under Section 18\\nunless Applicable Law provides otherwise).

The\\nComplaint alleges claims for breach of contract, professional negligence, and breach of fiduciary\\nduty.! Smith was subsequently granted, in a hearing the day before trial, leave to amend to allege\\ncauses of action for tortious interference with business relations, tortious interference with\\ncontract, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (“SCUTPA”).\\n\\nThis matter came before the Court for a non-jury trial during the June 5, 2017, term of\\ncourt. Smith appeared pro se. Kessler was present and represented by R. Scott Wallinger, Jr.,\\nEsquire. To accommodate schedules of various fact and expert witnesses and the Court, certain\\nof Kessler’s witnesses were offered by Kessler prior to Smith resting his case. Kessler offered\\nadditional evidence and testimony then rested. The Court allowed Smith generous leeway, well\\nbeyond what a litigant represented by counsel would normally be given, to question witnesses and\\n\\npresent evidence and offer legal arguments. Procedurally, at the close of Smith’s case, Kessler\\n\\n \\n\\n\\' Smith previously dismissed with prejudice his intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action.\\n\\n1\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nmoved for a directed verdict, which is properly construed in a non-jury trial as a motion for\\n\\ndismissal pursuant to Rule 41(b), SCRCP. For the following reasons, the Court grants Kessler’s\\n\\nmotion for involuntary dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(b), as Smith has shown no right to relief\\n\\nupon the facts and the law. Alternatively, the Court finds Smith has failed to prove each cause of\\n\\naction by a preponderance of the evidence and that judgment should be entered for Kessler.\\nFINDINGS OF FACT\\n\\n1. Smith is single, currently a resident of Louisiana, and has resided and worked for much of\\nhis adult life in the Charleston area. Smith is a college graduate and has worked in various\\ninformation technology positions for over 20 years.\\n\\n2. Kessler is a resident of Charleston, married with children, an experienced Licensed\\nIndependent Social Worker with a clinical practice designation, and is licensed by the State\\nof South Carolina. Kessler works full-time for the Veterans Administration Hospital in\\nCharleston, serving military personnel and veterans. For several years, including the\\nperiod of time relevant to this case between September and December 2012, Kessler has\\nalso worked part-time as a contract counselor and independent contractor for SAVE, Inc.\\n(“SAVE”) in Charleston. SAVE provides certain professional and counseling services to\\nemployees referred by Charleston-area employers. The Court will refer to such\\nprofessional counseling services by SAVE and Kessler as “employee assistance\\ncounseling.”\\n\\n3. Employee assistance counseling differs from other clinical counseling services. Employee\\nassistance counseling generally involves an employer referring its employee to SAVE for\\ncounseling of an employee about matters and difficulties an employee is having in the\\n\\nemployment setting. The employee is a clinical client of SAVE. The employer is a\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\ncontractual, non-clinical client of SAVE in that dual relationship. The employee is\\n\\né\\n\\ncounseled with a goal of resolving issues identified by the employer, the employee, or\\nSAVE for mutual benefit of the employee and employer. The counseling is intended to be\\nshort-term with no in-depth psychological or psychiatric diagnosis of the employee.\\nSAVE periodically makes a verbal report to the employer, within the limitations of\\nwhatever consent the employee has given, on the employee’s attendance and in some\\ninstances the progress in the counseling.\\n\\nBy virtue of Kessler’s education, training, professional career, and experience as a\\ncounselor with SAVE as reflected by his extensive testimony as well as that of two of his\\nwitnesses, Ms. Gainey and Mr. Krasilovsky, the Court finds that Kessler was and is\\nabundantly qualified to provide employee assistance counseling to Smith. The testimony\\nshowed Kessler was and is familiar with applicable standards of care relating to such\\ncounseling as well as to the limitations on communications Kessler could have with third-\\nparties and Smith’s employer. During lengthy questioning by Smith, Kessler demonstrated\\nhis professionalism, patience, and judgment. ,\\n\\nThe Court finds that Kessler is not a certified employee assistance professional or “CEAP”\\nand as such the standards applicable to CEAP’s are inapplicable to assessing the standard\\nof care owed by Kessler in this case. In referring to employee assistance counseling, the\\nCourt is not referring to whatever counseling a CEAP may be obligated to undertake by\\nvirtue of that designation.\\n\\nIn 2012, Smith was employed with Showa Denko, Carbon, Inc. (“Showa Denko”), a\\nDorchester County manufacturer, in the company’s information technology department.\\n\\nShowa Denko’s management had experienced significant difficulties with Smith’s\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nworkplace behavior and performance, and concluded that Smith needed to improvement of\\nhis interpersonal skills and interaction with other employees. Smith had exhibited hostility\\nto co-workers, used profanity, and expressed his interest in having the company make\\nvarious changes in its information technology and plant operations that were not deemed\\nnecessary or optimal by co-workers or by management.\\n\\nOn or about September 4, 2012, Smith was referred to SAVE for employee assistance\\ncounseling as a condition of Smith’s continued employment at Showa Denko. Smith\\nperformed various intake paperwork and had two counseling sessions -with Sarah Gainey,\\nLPC, the owner of SAVE. Ms. Gainey then decided the client-counselor relationship was\\nnot going well enough and she assigned Kessler, whom she supervised administratively, to\\ntake over counseling of Smith. Kessler, as a counselor for SAVE, began providing\\nemployee assistance counseling to Smith on September 25, 2012. Kessler was at all\\nrelevant times acting as an agent and servant of SAVE, under SAVE’s control, and for\\nbenefit of SAVE.\\n\\nAt the outset of Smith’s course of interaction with Kessler, Kessler explained his role, the\\nprocess, and obtained new written consent for Kessler and SAVE to periodically\\ncommunicate with Smith’s employer and disclose certain information, such as dates of\\nsessions, compliance, progress, and recommendations. (Def. Exhibit 6, Bates page 28).\\nSuch disclosures are a common part of employee assistance counseling, since the employer\\n\\nis also a client of SAVE. Smith was given ample opportunity to review the written consent\\n\\ndocumentation. The Court finds that Smith had the ability to understand and did understand\\n\\nthe various documents and disclosures he read and signed willingly and voluntarily, and\\n\\nthat there was no deception or malfeasance on the part of Kessler or SAVE in that regard.\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nze\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n10.\\n\\n11.\\n\\nThe Court finds that Smith was a clinical client of Kessler and SAVE and that Showa\\nDenko Carbon, Inc. was a non-clinical client of SAVE within the context of employer-\\nreferred counseling services.\\n\\nKessler met with Smith for employee assistance counseling sessions on September 25,\\nOctober 9, October 23, November 13, December 4, and December 18, 2012. After the\\nsession on October 23, 2012, Kessler notified Showa Denka that Kessler and Smith were\\ncontinuing to work on improving Smith’s interpersonal communication skills, the very\\nissue for which Showa Denka had referred Smith to SAVE of which Showa Denko had\\nrequested assistance. During the various sessions to that point in time, Smith resisted\\nengaging in the aspects of counseling discussions and strategies which Kessler felt\\nnecessary and appropriate to try to assist Smith. The evidence showed that Smith seemed\\nto want to focus on convincing Kessler that he was correct in his disputes with his fellow\\nemployees. However, Kessler tried unsuccessfully to explain to Smith that his role was\\nnot to mediate the dispute but rather to assist Smith to get along better with his fellow\\nemployees.\\n\\nAfter the October 23, 2012 counseling session, Kessler had no further contact with Showa\\nDenko. Unbeknownst to Kessler, Smith was engaging in various workplace endeavors and\\nprojects in direct violation of the orders of Smith’s supervisors.\\n\\nBecause of Smith’s unauthorized actions, and unrelated to any actions of Kessler, the\\nemployer decided to terminate Smith’s employment, which was an at-will position, for\\nsuch insubordination, and accordingly the employer terminated Smith on December 18,\\n2012. The Court finds the testimony and earlier sworn affidavit of John Wing to be the\\n\\nmost credible evidence of this fact. Mr. Wing was in management at Showa Denko during\\n\\n5 /\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\nE\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nthe period Smith was going to counseling at SAVE. Mr. Wing testified that he never had\\nany conversations or communications with Kessler, and was generally unfamiliar with the\\nservices and efforts Kessler was undertaking. Mr. Wing testified that Showa Denko\\ndecided to terminate Smith’s employment in December 2012 due to Smith’s\\ninsubordination, and that decision had nothing to do with SAVE or Kessler. Mr. Wing\\ntestified that when Smith was terminated, Smith was escorted from the premises. Kessler\\nwas not there and had no involvement in how such termination occurred. The Court finds\\nhis testimony to be credible and true. .\\n\\n12. After his termination, Smith went the same day to see Kessler for a final employee\\ncounseling session, although the evidence is clear that any services at that point would not\\nhave assisted Smith in keeping his position at Showa Denko. Smith advised Kessler that\\nSmith had been terminated. Kessler first learned of the termination at that session, but\\nKessler did not learn until sometime after filing of this lawsuit why Smith had been\\nterminated.”\\n\\n13. Kessler offered extensive testimony of a retained expert, Arthur Krasilovsky, who is a\\nLicensed Independent Social Worker and a Certified Employee Assistance Professional\\n(“CEAP”), and introduced his written report. Mr. Krasilovsky offered his opinions on the\\napplicable standards of care, and in particular opined that Kessler was obligated to follow\\nonly internal policies of SAVE, the NASW Code of Ethics, and South Carolina statutes\\nand regulations governing the practice of social work. Mr. Krasilovsky testified that\\n\\nbecause Kessler was not a CEAP, he was not obligated to follow the ethical and\\n\\n? The Court notes that Smith brought a separate suit against Showa Denko for alleged wrongful termination. That\\nsuit was settled under confidential terms and was dismissed. The actions of Showa Denko, whether or not proper in\\nSmith’s eyes, are not attributable to or the responsibility of Kessler or SAVE.\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n14,\\n\\n15.\\n\\n16.\\n\\nprofessional standards promulgated by the National Employee Assistance Professionals\\nAssociation, and those standards do not provide the minimum standard of care to be\\nfollowed by Kessler in his employee counseling services to Smith.\\n\\nMr. Krasilovsky opined that Kessler provided appropriate counseling to Smith, was not\\nnegligent in any aspects of those professional services, and did not deviate from the\\napplicable standards of care. Mr. Krasilovksy testified Kessler owed no duty to obtain any\\n“peer-consultation” or to refer Smith to other professionals, legal counsel, or regulatory\\nagency to assist with his employment difficulties. On cross-examination, Smith elicited\\nfurther testimony from the expert, to Smith’s detriment, that Smith was indeed disruptive\\nin the workplace, despite his counseling, and that the workplace controversy was not the\\nresult of the co-workers or supervisors, or to any hostile work environment, but was due to\\nSmith’s own behavior. The Court finds his testimony to be credible and persuasive.\\nKessler testified in his own defense consistently with Mr. Krasilovsky. The Court further\\nfinds the testimony of Kessler, including his recitation of his earlier written statement (PI.\\nEx. 1) which is incorporated herein. by reference, to be credible and true. The Court\\nconcludes that Kessler’s services to Smith were appropriate and within the applicable\\nstandard of care, and that Kessler did not communicate anything improper to any third\\nparty or to Showa Denko. The Court finds that Smith’s termination from Showa Denko\\nwas not done at the behest of, knowledge of, or with any participation by Kessler or SAVE.\\nSarah Gainey, LPC, the owner of SAVE, is a licensed professional counselor and has had\\na lengthy and successful career in employee assistance counseling. She is an expert in that\\n\\nfield. Ms. Gainey offered no criticisms of Kessler’s counseling of Smith and she expressed\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\na\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n17.\\n\\n18.\\n\\n19.\\n\\n20.\\n\\n21.\\n\\nfull confidence in Kessler. She further opined that Kessler performed his counseling\\nservices appropriately. The Court finds her testimony to be credible and true.\\n\\nSmith presented no expert testimony to establish any standard of care, any breach of any\\nstandard of care, or any causal relationship between any supposed breach and any damages\\nalleged to have been incurred.\\n\\nSmith testified that prior to his termination by Showa Denko, he had hoped to eventually\\nbecome the IT Manager at the plant. Beyond this hope Smith offered no evidence that\\nSmith was hired to assume that role or that he was likely to ever be promoted to that\\nposition. The Court finds that Smith had no employment contract with Showa Denko.\\nSmith testified that upon his termination he experienced emotional distress, particularly\\nassociated with the manner of his termination by the employer, which Smith alleges was\\nhumiliating. Smith offered no testimony or evidence, and notably no expert testimony, of\\nincurring any specific, diagnosable physical, emotional, or psychological injury, or any\\ntreatment, at any cost, arising from or because of his termination or arising from his\\nemployee assistance counseling with Kessler and SAVE.\\n\\nSmith offered as Exhibit 2 a “Profile XT” report which had been prepared during his\\nemployment with Showa Denko and which Smith maintains demonstrates various\\nbehavioral and psychological traits. The author of that report did not testify, the\\nmethodology and underlying test data is unknown, and the Court finds the report not\\nprobative as to proof of liability of Kessler or of any damages alleged by Smith.\\n\\nSmith offered as Exhibit 3 a SAVE marketing brochure about employee assistance\\ncounseling services. The Court finds that brochure to be accurate, but that Kessler was not\\n\\ninvolved in preparing or offering the brochure to the public or to Smith.\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\n22.\\n\\n23.\\n\\nSmith offered various e-mails and professional and work documentation as his Exhibits 5,\\n7, 8,9, 10 and 11. Although these were reviewed by Kessler in counseling sessions to the\\nextent necessary, they do not establish any liability of Kessler or damages to Smith from\\nany actions of Kessler or SAVE. Kessler’s expert, Mr. Krasilovsky, opined that that\\ninformation suggested that Smith, not others, was the cause of the workplace problems and\\nthe evidence on the whole supports that conclusion.\\n\\nAside from Smith testifying generally that he “lost his job,” Smith offered no testimony or\\nevidence of any specific pecuniary or economic loss associated with his job termination.\\nThe Court would have to speculate whether or when Smith attempted to or did obtain new\\nor other émployment, and whether at a lower, similar, or higher rate of compensation, and\\nwhether any economic or pecuniary loss actually occurred, and if so how much. In short,\\nSmith failed to offer any competent evidence as to prove any economic damages\\nrecoverable under any of the causes of action asserted.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\\n\\nGiving Smith all benefit of the doubt as to his Complaint’s factual and legal pleadings, the\\n\\nCourt addresses his causes of action:\\n\\nBreach of Contract\\n\\nTo recover for a breach of contract, Smith must prove: 1) a binding contract entered into\\n\\nby the parties; 2) breach of unjustifiable failure to perform; and 3) damages suffered as a direct\\n\\nand proximate result of the breach. Fuller v. Eastern Fire & Casualty Ins. Co., 240 S.C. 75, 124\\n\\nS.E.2d 602, 610 (1962). The Court finds that Smith had no contract with Kessler, but rather Smith\\n\\nhad a contract with SAVE for certain counseling services that SAVE agreed to undertake.\\n\\nAccordingly, Kessler himself owed no duty to Smith arising in contract.\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nFurthermore, regardless of whether a contract existed, as discussed above Smith proved no\\nbreach, nor any damages resulting from any breach that would be recoverable under contract law.\\nSmith’s claimed damages for “emotional distress” are not recoverable in contract, and, as\\ndiscussed hereinabove, no evidence was offered of economic damages. See Whitten v. American\\nMut. Liability Ins. Co., 468 F. Supp. 470, 473 (D.S.C. 1977) (“the law of this state makes no\\nprovision for the recovery of damages for emotional distress or mental anguish resulting from\\nbreach of contract, no matter what the intent of the breaching party was in failing to fulfill its\\nobligations.”).\\n\\nFinally, Smith fails to show that any such actions by Kessler were the proximate cause of\\nwhy he was fired by Showa Denko. The Court reiterates the earlier finding of fact that Smith was\\nfired by Showa Denko for his insubordination - actions with which Kessler had nothing to do.\\n\\nThe Court hereby grants Kessler’s motion for dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(b), SCRCP on\\nthis cause of action. Even if there were any evidence sufficient to deny that motion, the Court\\nfinds that by the preponderance of evidence that Kessler shall prevail on this cause of action.\\n\\nProfessional Negligence\\n\\nSmith asserts a professional negligence claim which requires him to provide evidence\\nshowing (1) the generally recognized and accepted practices and procedures that would be\\nfollowed by average, competent practitioners under the same or similar circumstances; (2) that\\nKessler departed from the recognized and generally accepted standards; and (3) that Kessler’s\\ndeparture from such generally-recognized practices and procedures was the proximate cause of\\nSmith’s alleged injuries and damages. David v. McLeod Reg’! Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 248, 626\\nS.E.2d 1, 4 (2006). Smith must provide expert testimony to establish both the required standard\\n\\nof care and the Kessler’s failure to conform to that standard, unless the subject matter lies within\\n\\n10\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nthe ambit of common knowledge so that no special learning is required to evaluate the conduct of\\nKessler. /d.; see also Gilliland v. Elmwood Props., 301 S.C. 295, 301, 391 S.E.2d 577, 580 (1990);\\nTommy L. Griffin Plumbing & Heating Co. v. Jordan, Jones & Goulding, Inc., 351 S.C. 459, 472,\\n570 S.E.2d 197, 203 (Ct. App. 2002). Smith, as a lay witness, cannot testify as to the standard of\\ncare that applies to Kessler or any deviations therefrom. See Rule 701, SCRE.\\n\\nThe Court finds that the subject matter herein is beyond the ambit of “common\\nknowledge.” As discussed above, Smith presented no testimony or evidence, and most notably\\npresented no expert testimony, of any unprofessional, improper, or negligent act or omission by\\nKessler, nor any deviation from the standard of care. Such expert testimony is necessary in this\\ncase, as the matter of employee assistance counselling is not within the ambit of common\\nknowledge. To the contrary, Kessler and two other experts demonstrated Kessler complied with\\nthe standard of care in his provision of employee assistance counseling to Smith. Kessler’s\\ncommunications with the employer, the last of which occurred around October 23, 2012, were all\\nwell within the parameters to which Smith previously had given his express consent, and were\\nmade with Smith’s consent. The Court finds Kessler owed no duty to obtain a “peer consultation”\\nas alleged by Smith. The Court further finds Kessler owed no duty to refer Smith to other\\nclinicians, legal counsel, or government agencies for further assistance. Finally, regardless of\\nwhether Smith could prove a breach of duty, no act or omission on the part of Kessler caused\\nShowa Denko to terminate Smith’s employment. In short, the Court finds that none of Kessler’s\\ncommunications with, services to, or advice to Smith were in any way inadequate, improper,\\nunprofessional, negligent, or fraudulent, and that there was no breach of any professional duty or\\n\\ndeviation from the applicable standard of care.\\n\\n11\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nFor the same reasons discussed hereinabove, the Court finds that Smith has failed to prove\\nany damages recoverable under this cause of action.\\n\\nAgain, Smith fails to show that any such actions by Kessler were the proximate cause of\\nwhy he was fired by Showa Denko. The Court reiterates the earlier finding of fact that Smith was\\nfired by Showa Denko for his insubordination - actions with which Kessler had nothing to do.\\n\\nTherefore, the Court grants Kessler’s motion for dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(b) on this\\ncause of action. In the alternative, even if there were any evidence sufficient to deny that motion,\\nthe Court finds that by the preponderance of evidence that Kessler shall prevail on this cause of\\naction.\\n\\nBreach of Fiduciary Duty\\n\\n“To establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, [Smith] must prove (1) the existence of\\na fiduciary duty, (2) a breach of that duty, and (3) damages proximately resulting from the wrongful\\nconduct of Kessler.” Turpin v. Lowther, 404 S.C. 581, 745 S.E.2d 397, 401 (Ct. App. 2013). The\\nCourt finds that Smith failed to prove any breach of fiduciary duty or that such breach caused any\\ndamages to Smith recoverable under such a cause of action.\\n\\nAgain, Smith fails to show that any such actions by Kessler were the proximate cause of\\nwhy he was fired by Showa Denko. The Court reiterates the earlier finding of fact that Smith was\\nfired by Showa Denko for his insubordination - actions with which Kessler had nothing to do.\\n\\nThe Court hereby grants Kessler’s motion for dismissal of this claim pursuant to Rule\\n41(b), SCRCP. Even if there were any evidence sufficient to deny that motion, the Court finds\\n\\nthat by the preponderance of evidence that Kessler shall prevail on this cause of action.\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nTortious Interference with Business Relations\\n\\nThe elements of this cause of action are (1) intentional interference with prospective\\ncontractual relations, (2) for an improper purpose or by improper methods, and (3) resulting injury.\\nCrandall Corp. v. Navistar Int\\'l Transp. Corp., 302 S.C. 265, 266, 395 S.E.2d 179, 180 (1990).\\nThe Court finds that Smith has failed to prove any of the elements of this cause of action and has\\nfailed to prove any damages recoverable thereunder.\\n\\nAgain, Smith fails to show that any such actions by Kessler were the proximate cause of\\nwhy he was fired by Showa Denko. The Court reiterates the earlier finding of fact that Smith was.\\nfired by Showa Denko for his insubordination - actions with which Kessler had nothing to do.\\n\\nThe Court hereby grants Kessler’s motion for dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(b) on this\\ncause of action. Alternatively, even if there were any evidence sufficient to deny that motion, the\\nCourt finds that by the preponderance of evidence that Kessler shall prevail on this cause of action.\\n\\nTortious Interference with Contract\\n\\nTo establish intentional interference with a contract, Smith must prove: (1) a contract; (2)\\nthe wrongdoer\\'s knowledge thereof; (3) his intentional procurement of its breach; (4) the absence\\nof justification; and (5) the damage resulting therefrom. Camp v. Springs Mortgage Co., 310 S.C.\\n514, 426 S.E.2d 304 (1992); DeBerry v. McCain, 275 S.C. 569, 274 S.E.2d 293 (1981). The Court\\nfinds that Smith has failed to prove any of the elements of this cause of action and has failed to\\nprove any damages recoverable thereunder.\\n\\nAgain, Smith fails to show that any such actions by Kessler were the proximate cause of\\nwhy he was fired by Showa Denko. The Court reiterates the earlier finding of fact that Smith was\\n\\nfired by Showa Denko for his insubordination - actions with which Kessler had nothing to do.\\n\\n13\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nThe Court hereby grants Kessler’s motion for dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(b) on this\\ncause of action. Furthermore, even assuming sufficient evidence existed to deny that motion, the\\nCourt finds that by the preponderance of evidence that Kessler shall prevail on this cause of action.\\n\\nUnfair Trade Practices Act\\n\\nTo recover in an action under the SCUTPA, Smith must show: (1) Kessler engaged in an\\nunfair or deceptive act in the conduct of trade or commerce; (2) unfair or deceptive act affected\\nthe public interest; and (3) Smith suffered monetary or property loss as a result of the Kessler\\'s\\nunfair or deceptive act. S.C. Code Ann. § 395-10 et seg.; Health Promotion Specialists, LLC v.\\nS.C. Bd. of Dentistry, 403 S.C, 623, 743 S.E.2d 808 (2013). “An act is ‘unfair’ when it is offensive\\nto public policy or when it is immoral, unethical, or oppressive.” Jd. The Court finds that Smith\\nhas failed to prove any of the elements of this cause of action and has failed to prove any damages\\nrecoverable thereunder.\\n\\nAgain, Smith fails to show that any such actions by Kessler were the proximate cause of\\nwhy he was fired by Showa Denko. The Court reiterates the earlier finding of fact that Smith was\\nfired by Showa Denko for his insubordination - actions with which Kessler had nothing to do.\\n\\nAccordingly, Kessler’s motion for dismissal of Smith’s SCUTPA claim is granted pursuant\\nto Rule 41(b). In the alternative, considering the evidence presented, the Court finds that by the\\npreponderance of evidence that Kessler shall prevail on this cause of action.\\n\\nApplication of S.C. Code Ann. § 19-11-95\\n\\nKessler asserts Smith’s claims are barred by S.C. Code Ann. § 19-11-95(C)(1) and (H).\\n\\nThis statute provides that “a provider may reveal: (1) confidences with the written authorization\\n\\nof the patient or patients affected, but only after disclosure to them of what confidences are to be\\n\\n14 4\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n=\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nrevealed and to whom they will be revealed.” S.C. Code Ann. § 19-11-95(C)(1). The statute\\nfurther provides:\\n\\nA provider releasing a confidence under the written authorization of the patient or\\n\\nunder the provisions of this section is not liable to the patient or other person for\\n\\nrelease of the confidence to the person authorized to receive it; provided, however,\\n\\na patient has a cause of action for damages against a provider, associate, agent,\\n\\nemployee, or any other person who intentionally, wilfully, or with gross negligence\\n\\nviolates the provisions of this section.\\nS.C. Code Ann. § 19-11-95(H).\\n\\nAs previously outlined, Kessler fully explained the employee assistance counseling\\nconcept to Smith prior to beginning counseling and obtained written consent for Kessler and SAVE\\nto periodically communicate with Smith’s employer and disclose certain information, such as dates\\nof sessions, compliance, progress, and recommendations. Smith knowingly and voluntarily\\nexecuted this authorization. There was no evidence of fraud or other deception by Kessler in\\nobtaining the requisite authorization, nor that Kessler intentionally, willfully, or with gross\\nnegligence violated S.C. Code Ann. § 19-11-95. Therefore, the Court finds Kessler’s\\ncommunications with Showa Denko complied with S.C.

All replacements and additions shall\\nalso be covered by this Security Instrument. All of the foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument\\nas the “Property.”\\n\\nBORROWER COVENANTS that Borrower is lawfully seised of the estate hereby conveyed and\\nhas the right to grant and convey the Property and that the Property is unencumbered, except for\\nencumbrances of record. Borrower warrants and will defend generally the title to the Property against all\\nclaims and demands, subject to any encumbrances of record.\\n\\nTHIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use and non-uniform\\ncovenants with limited variations by jurisdiction to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real\\nproperty.\\n\\nUNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:\\n\\n1. Payment of Principal, interest, Escrow Items, Prepayment Charges, and Late Charges.\\nBorrower shall pay when due the principal of, and interest on, the debt evidenced by the Note and any\\nPrepayment charges and late charges due under the Note. Borrower shall also pay funds for Escrow\\nItems pursuant to Section 3. Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument shall be made\\nin U.S. currency. However, if any check or other instrument received by Lender as payment under the\\nNote or this Security Instrument is returned to Lender unpaid, Lender may require that any or all\\nsubsequent payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument be made in one or more of the\\nfollowing forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check,\\ntreasurer\\'s check or cashier’s check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose\\ndeposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer.\\n\\nPayments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note\\nor at such other location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in\\nSection 15. Lender may return any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are\\ninsufficient to bring the Loan current. Lender may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to\\nbring the Loan current, without waiver of any rights hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such\\npayment or partial payments in the future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such payments at the time\\nsuch payments are accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date, then\\nLender need not pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower\\nmakes payment to bring the Loan current. If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of time,\\nLender shall either apply such funds or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be\\napplied to the outstanding principal balance under the Note immediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or\\nclaim which Borrower might have now or in the future against Lender shall relieve Borrower from making\\npayments due under the Note and this Security Instrument or performing the covenants and agreements\\nsecured by this Security Instrument.\\n\\n2. Application of Payments or Proceeds.

Such payments\\nshall be applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in which it became due. Any remaining amounts\\nshall be applied first to late charges, second to any other amounts due under this Security Instrument,\\nand then to reduce the principal balance of the Note.\\n\\nIf Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a\\nsufficient amount to pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and\\nthe late charge. If more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment\\nreceived from Borrower to the repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each\\npayment can be paid in full. To the extent that any excess exists after the payment is applied to the full\\npayment of one or more Periodic Payments, such excess may be applied to any late charges due.\\nVoluntary prepayments shall be applied first to any prepayment charges and then as described in the\\nNote.\\n\\nAny application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due\\nunder the Note shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic\\nPayments.\\n\\n3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are\\ndue under the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the “Funds”) to provide for payment of amounts\\ndue for: (a) taxes and assessments and other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument\\nas a lien or encumbrance on the Property; (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if\\nany; (c) premiums for any and all insurance required by Lender under Section 5; and (d) Mortgage\\nInsurance premiums, if any, or any sums payable by Borrower to Lender in lieu of the payment of\\nMortgage Insurance premiums in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. These items are called\\n“Escrow items.” At origination or at any time during the term of the Loan, Lender may require that\\nCommunity Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be escrowed by Borrower, and such dues,\\nfees and assessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender all notices of\\namounts to be paid under this Section. Borrower shail pay Lender the Funds for Escrow ‘tems unless\\nLender waives Borrower\\'s obligation to pay the Funds for any or all Escrow Items. Lender may waive\\nBorrower\\'s obligation to pay to Lender Funds for any or all Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver\\nmay only be in writing. In the event of such waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where\\npayable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of Funds has been waived by Lender\\nand, if Lender requires, shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within such time period\\nas Lender may require. Borrower\\'s obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for all\\npurposes be deemed to be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security instrument, as the\\nphrase “covenant and agreement” is used in Section 9. !f Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items\\ndirectly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may\\nexercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated under\\nSection 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow\\nItems at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section 15 and, upon such revocation, Borrower\\nshall pay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.\\n\\nLender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to\\napply the Funds at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a\\nlender can require under RESPA.

Charges; Liens. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions\\nattributable to the Property which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, leasehold payments or\\nground rents on the Property, if any, and Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any.\\nTo the extent that these items are Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them in the manner provided in\\nSection 3.\\n\\nBorrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument\\nunless Borrower: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner\\nacceptable to Lender, but only so long as Borrower is performing such agreement; (b) contests the lien in\\ngood faith by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender\\'s opinion\\noperate to prevent the enforcement of the lien while those proceedings are pending, but only until such\\nproceedings are concluded; or (c) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to\\nLender subordinating the tien to this Security Instrument. If Lender determines that any part of the\\nProperty is subject to a lien which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, Lender may give\\nBorrower a notice identifying the lien. Within 10 days of the date on which that notice is given, Borrower\\nshall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions set forth above in this Section 4.\\n\\nLender may require Borrower to pay a one-time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or\\nreporting service used by Lender in connection with this Loan.\\n\\n5. Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter\\nerected on the Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term “extended\\ncoverage,” and any other hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender\\nrequires insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts (including deductible levels) and\\nfor the periods that Lender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can\\nchange during the term of the Loan. The insurance carrier providing the insurance shall be chosen by\\nBorrower subject to Lender\\'s right to disapprove Borrower\\'s choice, which right shall not be exercised\\nunreasonably. Lender may require Borrower to pay, in connection with this Loan, either: (a) a one-time\\ncharge for flood zone determination, certification and tracking services; or (b) a one-time charge for flood\\nzone determination and certification services and subsequent charges each time remappings or similar\\nchanges occur which reasonably might affect such determination or certification. Borrower shall also be\\nresponsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in\\nconnection with the review of any flood zone determination resulting from an objection by Borrower.\\n\\nIf Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance\\ncoverage, at Lender\\'s option and Borrower\\'s expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any\\nparticular type or amount of coverage.

These amounts shall bear\\ninterest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon\\nnotice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.\\n\\nAll insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to\\nLender\\'s right to disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name\\nLender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.

During such repair and restoration period,\\nLender shall have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to\\ninspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender\\'s satisfaction, provided that\\nsuch inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and\\nrestoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an\\nagreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such insurance proceeds,\\nLender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such proceeds. Fees for public\\nadjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower shall not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and\\nshall be the sole obligation of Borrower. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or\\nLender\\'s security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by\\nthis Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such\\ninsurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.\\n\\nIf Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance\\nclaim and related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the\\ninsurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-\\nday period will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under\\nSection 22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower\\'s rights to any insurance\\nproceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument,\\nand (b) any other of Borrower\\'s rights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by\\nBorrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to the\\ncoverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the\\nProperty or to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.\\n\\n6. Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower\\'s principal\\nresidence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the\\nProperty as Borrower\\'s principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless\\nLender otherwise agrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless\\nextenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower\\'s control.\\n\\n7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower shall\\nnot destroy, damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the\\nProperty.

If it has\\nreasonable cause, Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property.

Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application\\nprocess, Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower\\'s\\nknowledge or consent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to\\nLender (or failed to provide Lender with material information) in connection with the Loan. Material\\nrepresentations include, but are not limited to, representations concerning Borrower\\'s occupancy of the\\nProperty as Borrower\\'s principal residence.\\n\\n9. Protection of Lender’s Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security\\nInstrument. If (a) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security\\nInstrument, (b) there is a legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender\\'s interest in the Property\\nand/or rights under this Security Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for\\ncondemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien which may attain priority over this Security\\nInstrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender\\nmay do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender\\'s interest in the Property and\\nrights under this Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property, and\\nsecuring and/or repairing the Property. Lender’s actions can include, but are not limited to: (a) paying\\nany sums secured by a lien which has priority over this Security Instrument; (b) appearing in court; and\\n(c) paying reasonable attorneys’ fees to protect its interest in the Property and/or rights under this\\nSecurity Instrument, including its secured position in a bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property\\nincludes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to make repairs, change locks, replace or board up\\ndoors and windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate building or other code violations or dangerous\\nconditions, and have utilities turned on or off. Although Lender may take action under this Section 9,\\nLender does not have to do so and is not under any duty or obligation to do so. It is agreed that Lender\\nincurs no liability for not taking any or all actions authorized under this Section 9.\\n\\nAny amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shalt become additional debt of Borrower\\nsecured by this Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of\\ndisbursement and shall be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting\\npayment.\\n\\nIf this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of the\\nlease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge unless\\nLender agrees to the merger in writing.\\n\\n10. Mortgage Insurance.

Lender\\ncan no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the amount and for the\\nperiod that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes available, is\\nobtained, and Lender requires separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage\\nInsurance.

Nothing in this Section 10 affects Borrower\\'s obligation to pay interest at the\\nrate provided in the Note.\\n\\nMortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses\\nit may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage\\nInsurance.\\n\\nMortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and\\nmay enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses.

These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make\\npayments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include\\nfunds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums).\\n\\nAs a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any\\nreinsurer, any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly)\\namounts that derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower\\'s payments for Mortgage\\nInsurance, in exchange for sharing or modifying the mortgage insurer\\'s risk, or reducing losses. If such\\nagreement provides that an affiliate of Lender takes a share of the insurer\\'s risk in exchange for a share\\nof the premiums paid to the insurer, the arrangement is often termed “captive reinsurance.” Further:\\n\\n(a) Any such agreements will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for\\nMortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the\\namount Borrower will owe for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any\\nrefund.\\n\\n(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has — if any — with respect to\\nthe Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other law. These\\nrights may include the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of\\nthe Mortgage Insurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance terminated automatically, and/or to\\nreceive a refund of any Mortgage Insurance premiums that were unearned at the time of such\\ncancellation or termination.\\n\\n11.

The notice address shall be the Property\\nAddress unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice address by notice to Lender. Borrower shall\\npromptly notify Lender of Borrower\\'s change of address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting\\nBorrower\\'s change of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address through that\\nspecified procedure. There may be only one designated notice address under this Security Instrument at\\nany one time. Any notice to Lender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to\\nLender\\'s address stated herein unless Lender has designated another address by notice to Borrower.\\nAny notice in connection with this Security Instrument shall not be deemed to have been given to Lender\\nuntil actually received by Lender.

Borrower’s Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security\\nInstrument.\\n\\n18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18,\\n“Interest in the Property” means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited\\nto, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract\\nor escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a future date to a\\npurchaser.\\n\\nIf all or any part of the Property or any interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if\\nBorrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without\\nLender\\'s prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this\\nSecurity Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited\\nby Applicable Law.\\n\\nIf Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice\\nshall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with\\nSection 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower\\nfails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted\\nby this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.\\n\\n19. Borrower’s Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions,\\nBorrower shall have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time\\nprior to the earliest of: (a) five days before sale of the Property pursuant to Section 22 of this Security\\nInsrtrument; (b) such other period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Borrower\\'s right\\nto reinstate; or (c) entry of a judgment enforcing this Security Instrument. Those conditions are that\\nBorrower: (a) pays Lender all sums which then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note\\nas if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of any other covenants or agreements; (c) pays\\nall expenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to, reasonable\\nattorneys’ fees, property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose of\\nprotecting Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument; and (d) takes such\\naction as Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender\\'s interest in the Property and rights under\\nthis Security Instrument, and Borrower\\'s obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument,\\nshall continue unchanged. Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and\\nexpenses in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order;\\n(c) certified check, bank check, treasurer\\'s check or cashier\\'s check, provided any such check is drawn\\nupon an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or entity; or\\n(d) Electronic Funds Transfer. Upon reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and obligations\\nsecured hereby shall remain fully effective as if no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to\\nreinstate shall not apply in the case of acceleration under Section 18.\\n\\n20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial\\ninterest in the Note (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior\\nnotice to Borrower.

There\\nalso might be one or more changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note.

The preceding two sentences shall not apply to the presence, use, or storage on\\nthe Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate\\nto normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous\\nsubstances in consumer products).\\n\\nBorrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand,\\nlawsuit or other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property\\nand any Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any\\nEnvironmental Condition, including but not limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of\\nrelease of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) any condition caused by the presence, use or release of a\\nHazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified\\nby any governmental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that any removal or other remediation\\nof any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall promptly take all\\nnecessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any\\nobligation on Lender for an Environmental Cleanup.\\n\\nNON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:\\n\\n22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration\\nfollowing Borrower’s breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not\\nprior to acceleration under Section 18 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise).

The laws of South Carolina provide that in any real estate\\nforeclosure proceeding a defendant against whom a personal judgment is taken or asked may within 30\\ndays after the sale of the mortgaged property apply to the court for an order of appraisal. The statutory\\nappraisal value as approved by the court would be substituted for the high bid and may decrease the\\namount of any deficiency owing in connection with the transaction.

Within\\n\\nseven (7) days after executing a lease agreement for the lease of a Unit, the Unit Owner (sometimes\\nhereinafter referred to as the “Landlord”) shall provide the Board of Directors with a copy of the\\nlease and the name of the lessee and all other people occupying the Unit. The Unit Owner shall\\nprovide the lessee with copies of the Master Deed, By-Laws together with any and all exhibits,\\nschedules, or certificates thereto (the “Regime Documents”) and the Rules and Regulations (the\\n“Regime Rules”). If the Unit Owner fails to provide the lessee with a copy of Regime Documents\\nand the Regime Rules, the Unit Owner shall be subject to a fine by the Association of at least $500.\\nThe Board shall have the authority to increase such fine and shall be entitled to treat the fine as an\\nassessment against the Unit.\\n\\n(vi) Every Lease ofa Unit shall incorporate a provision indicating that the\\ntenant of the Leased Premises has received a copy of this Article 15 and agreeing to abide by the\\nprovisions of this Article 15. Failure by the tenant of the Leased Premises to acknowledge receipt of\\nacopy of this Article 15 and to agree to abide by its terms shall constitute a material event of default\\nunder the lease and shall entitle the Association or the Owner of the Leased Premises to terminate the\\nlease immediately.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b) Compliance with Master Deed, By-Laws, and Regime Rules, Use of Common\\nElements, and Liability for Assessments. Any lease of a Unit (the “Lease”) shall be deemed to\\ncontain the following provisions, whether or not expressly therein stated, and each Owner and each\\nlessee, by occupancy of a Unit, covenants and agrees that any lease of a Unit shall contain the\\nfollowing language and agrees that if such language is not expressly contained therein, then such\\nlanguage shall be incorporated into the lease by existence of this covenant on the Unit.\\n\\n(i) Compliance with Regime Documents and Regime Rules. The lessee\\nshall comply with all provisions of the Regime Documents, and Regime Rules adopted pursuant\\nthereto and shall control the conduct of all other occupants and guests of the Leased Unit in order to\\nensure compliance with the foregoing. The Owner shall cause all occupants of his or her Unit to\\ncomply with the Regime Documents, and the Regime Rules adopted pursuant thereto, and shall be\\nresponsible for all violations by such occupants, notwithstanding the fact that such occupants of the\\nUnit are fully liable and may be sanctioned for any violation of the Regime Documents and Regime\\nRules adopted pursuant thereto. In the event that the lessee, or a person living with the lessee,\\nviolates the Regime Documents or a Regime Rule for which a fine is imposed, notice of the violation\\nshall be given to the Owner and the lessee, and such fine shall be assessed against the lessee in\\naccordance with Article 3, Section 3.23 of the By-Laws. If the fine is not paid by the lessee within\\nthe time period set by the Board, the Board may assess the fine against the Owner and the Owner\\nshall pay the fine upon notice from the Association of the lessee\\'s failure to pay the fine. Unpaid\\nfines shall constitute an assessment and lien against the Unit.\\n\\nAny violation of the Regime Documents or Regime Rules adopted pursuant thereto by the\\nlessee, any occupant, or any person living with the lessee, is deemed to be a default under the terms\\nof the lease and authorizes the Owner to terminate the lease without liability and to evict the lessee in\\naccordance with South Carolina law. The Owner hereby delegates and assigns to the Association,\\nacting through the Board, the power and authority of enforcement against the lessee for breaches\\nresulting from the violation of the Regime Documents and the Regime Rules adopted pursuant\\nthereto, including the power and authority to evict the lessee as attorney-in-fact on behalf and for the\\n\\n{01377792.}\\n00375526. 5\\n\\n« § 5d: p09 5d EPTO XG OWY\\n\\x0c\\n\\n(Handwritten Text):\\n2\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n(Printed Text):\\nbenefit of the Owner, in accordance with the terms hereof. In the event the Association proceeds to\\nevict the lessee, any costs, including attorney\\'s fees and court costs, associated with the eviction shall\\nbe an assessment and lien against the Unit.\\n\\n(ii) Use of Common Elements. Except where the Owner also occupies the\\nUnit, the Owner transfers and assigns to the lessee, for the term of the lease, any and all rights and\\nprivileges that the Owner has to use the Common Elements of the Regime, including, but not limited\\nto, the use of any and all recreational facilities. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that the\\nAssociation reserves the right to withhold from Tenant access to Common Element amenities in the\\nevent that Tenant falls to comply with any of the provisions of the Regime Documents or the Regime\\nRules.\\n\\n(iii) Liability for Assessments. When a Unit Owner who is leasing his or\\nher Unit fails to pay any annual special, or specific assessment or any other charge for a period of\\nmore than thirty (30) days after it is due and payable, then the delinquent Owner hereby consents to\\nthe assignment of any rent received from the lessee during the period of delinquency, and, upon\\nrequest by the Board, lessee shall pay to the Association all unpaid annual, special, and specific\\nassessments and other charges payable during and prior to the term of the lease and any other period\\nof occupancy by lessee. However, lessee need not make such payments to the Association in excess\\nof, or prior to the due dates for, monthly rental payments unpaid at the time of the Board\\'s request.\\nAll such payments made by lessee shall reduce, by the same amount, lessee\\'s obligation to make\\nmonthly rental payments to lessor. If lessee fails to comply with the Board\\'s request to pay\\nassessments or other charges, lessee shall pay to the Association all amounts authorized under this\\nMaster Deed as if lessee were an Owner. The above provision shall not be construed to release the\\nOwner from any obligation, including the obligation for assessments, for which he or she would\\notherwise be responsible.\\n\\n(iv) Subject to Regime Documents and Regime Rules. The Lease is\\nsubject to and consistent with the provisions of the Regime Documents and the Regime Rules, as the\\nsame may be amended from time to time.

The right of Tenant to use and occupy the Leased\\nPremises shall be subject and subordinate in all respect to the provision of the Master Deed, the By-\\nLaws, and such Regime Rules as the Board of Directors of the Association my promulgate from time\\nto time.\\n\\n(v) Tenant Acknowledgment of Receipt of Regime Documents and\\nRegime Rules.
